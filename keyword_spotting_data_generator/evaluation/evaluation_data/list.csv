NobHlGUjV3g,35040,89280,introduce you to linked list data structure,1,1
NobHlGUjV3g,89280,178384,in our previous lesson we tried to implement a dynamic list using arrays and,1,1
NobHlGUjV3g,349904,401744,to be able to understand linked list well,1,1
NobHlGUjV3g,3261264,3352304,now albert needs to store a list of integers a list of numbers,2,2
NobHlGUjV3g,3386704,3439184,integers in this list will be 4,1,1
NobHlGUjV3g,5053904,5081104,store his list,1,1
NobHlGUjV3g,5279184,5321760,have one more element in this list,1,1
NobHlGUjV3g,6632624,6685104,and now he can add one more element to this list,1,1
NobHlGUjV3g,6757280,6791040,more numbers in the list,1,1
NobHlGUjV3g,6916304,6982864,and albert is it still feeling bad because if the list is too small,1,1
NobHlGUjV3g,7061760,7127984,and if the list again grows too much he will again have to,1,1
NobHlGUjV3g,7385104,7408944,linked list,1,1
NobHlGUjV3g,7445760,7498544,linked list data structure and see how it solves,1,1
NobHlGUjV3g,7883520,7925424,this list of four integers in the memory,1,1
NobHlGUjV3g,9032800,9085920,element in the list and this is the second element in the list,2,2
NobHlGUjV3g,9551840,9592000,the first block in the list and this is the,1,1
NobHlGUjV3g,9592000,9618720,second block in the list,1,1
NobHlGUjV3g,10507360,10524944,end of the list,1,1
NobHlGUjV3g,10912960,10931200,in the list,1,1
NobHlGUjV3g,11189760,11222880,the next node on the list,1,1
NobHlGUjV3g,11816320,11850720,of the next node in the list,1,1
NobHlGUjV3g,11850720,11924800,so if we store the list like this in the memory as these noncontiguous,1,1
NobHlGUjV3g,11958560,12018720,but then this is a linked list data structure,1,1
NobHlGUjV3g,12018720,12066400,logical view of the linked list data structure will be something like,1,1
NobHlGUjV3g,12283840,12357440,and the only information about the list that we keep all the time is,1,1
NobHlGUjV3g,12410400,12485600,so address of the head node kind of gives us access to the complete list,1,1
NobHlGUjV3g,12613280,12661600,now if we want to traverse the linked list,1,1
NobHlGUjV3g,12913120,12937920,in the linked list,1,1
NobHlGUjV3g,12937920,12994880,if we want to insert a node in the linked list,1,1
NobHlGUjV3g,12994880,13050400,lets say we want to add number three at the end of the linked list,1,1
NobHlGUjV3g,13050400,13110880,then all we need to do is first create a node in the linked list,1,1
NobHlGUjV3g,13911360,13927520,the linked list,1,1
NobHlGUjV3g,14150064,14216320,element in the list we could calculate the address of the element,1,1
NobHlGUjV3g,14570384,14625904,to the size of the list lets say the size of the list is n there are n,2,2
NobHlGUjV3g,14625904,14647840,elements in the list,1,1
NobHlGUjV3g,14883520,14913600,insertion into the list,1,1
NobHlGUjV3g,14913600,14979200,we can insert anywhere in the list we first need to create a node and,1,1
NobHlGUjV3g,15050880,15119040,10 at 3rd position in the list so all we need to do is create a node store,1,1
NobHlGUjV3g,15382720,15432320,now to insert also we will have to traverse the list and got to that,1,1
NobHlGUjV3g,15787520,15818560,from this list will also o,1,1
NobHlGUjV3g,15818560,15860000,so we can see some good things about linked list,1,1
NobHlGUjV3g,16140800,16196000,we do not have to guess the size of the list beforehand like in the case of,1,1
NobHlGUjV3g,16226080,16279840,we will discuss all the operations on linked list and the cost,1,1
NobHlGUjV3g,16341120,16415680,in our next lessons we will also be implementing linked list in c,1,1
NobHlGUjV3g,16434080,16487840,so this is all for a basic introduction to linked list,1,1
P4GydOp6Nek,402240,468464,is definitely on their list but when,1,1

W8KRzm-HUcc,26400,101744,this video well be learning about lists,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,240480,304800,that means so first lets look at lists,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,304800,360960,the time on lists just because it has a,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,396960,468000,it allows us to work with a list of,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,468000,550080,wanted a list of courses so i could,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,550080,627824,and to create a list were going to use,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,719040,823040,lets say that we wanted a list of,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,975824,1060320,list so ill print out courses and run,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,1060320,1137600,our entire list now if we wanted to see,1,2
W8KRzm-HUcc,1103520,1181760,how many values are in our list then we,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,1338240,1413600,and our list and we can access each of,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,1413600,1500000,go back to just printing out our list,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,1500000,1581600,values in our list we can use square,1,2
W8KRzm-HUcc,1532144,1626240,brackets after our list and pass in the,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,1740480,1847024,value of our list we can access the,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,1875360,1947840,since the length of our list is 4 that,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,2087040,2171024,value for my list which is comps,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,2485920,2575680,the list so since 0 is the first item of,1,2
W8KRzm-HUcc,2532000,2623200,our list i can also get the last item of,1,2
W8KRzm-HUcc,2575680,2677440,our list using a negative 1 so if we,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,2860784,2952480,what the length of the list is so for,1,2
W8KRzm-HUcc,2905440,2985584,example if my list grew by 10 items then,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,3261104,3333104,that we get this list index out of range,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,3400784,3487664,two values from this list then i could,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,4498064,4583504,this list then we can say that we want,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,4688624,4755840,go all the way to the end of the list so,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,5095184,5158064,look at some list methods that we have,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,5158064,5203664,our list,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,5203664,5282400,an item to our list there are a couple,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,5314064,5380800,our list then we could use the append,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,5563184,5633280,just print out our courses list and run,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,5633280,5707664,appended here to the end of the list now,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,5707664,5773424,specific location in our list then we,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,5927504,6033584,the beginning of our list then we could,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,6387840,6440144,list,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,6550064,6625920,want to add to our list so for example,1,2
W8KRzm-HUcc,6587984,6675840,lets say that we have another list here,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,6675840,6794880,equal to another list with art and,1,2
W8KRzm-HUcc,6739984,6843360,education in this list and we want to,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,6843360,6881760,list,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,6965280,7044000,list lets instead insert these courses,1,2
W8KRzm-HUcc,7012800,7081920,to the beginning of our list so lets go,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,7081920,7162544,the beginning of our list that it,1,2
W8KRzm-HUcc,7119840,7208144,actually added the entire list of,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,7208144,7309920,so we can actually have a list within a,1,2
W8KRzm-HUcc,7267664,7348800,list like we have here so if we were to,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,7348800,7425104,list so ill print out the index of 0,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,7425104,7502880,the first value is actually this list,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,7534064,7612800,values from our second list to our,1,2
W8KRzm-HUcc,7573920,7655504,original list now that is why we use the,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,8015504,8099024,values from our second list here to our,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,8228160,8339504,the list itself on there instead of the,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,8373120,8480640,item is extended onto that list ok so,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,8516640,8564640,list,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,8749920,8828160,math was removed from the courses list,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,8950560,9038400,of our list now this is useful if we,1,2
W8KRzm-HUcc,8993280,9086400,want to use our list like a stack or a,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,9134400,9198720,off of our list and now we just have,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,9556320,9635520,at the list so if you had a stack or a,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,9635520,9711360,keep popping off values until your list,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,9711360,9779040,we can sort our list in a couple of,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,9805920,9877440,our list as it currently is now this is,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,10112160,10193760,of reversing our list what if we wanted,1,2
W8KRzm-HUcc,10147200,10240320,to sort our list now sorting is just as,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,10282080,10357920,see that now our list is sorted in,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,10357920,10436640,math physics now if our list contained,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,10479360,10554720,another list here of numbers ill just,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,11014560,11088000,our reverse method on the list after,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,11575680,11647200,its just altering the list in place but,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,11647200,11730720,sorted version of our list without,1,2
W8KRzm-HUcc,11685120,11781600,altering the original list so what if we,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,11781600,11882400,list without altering the original so to,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,11924160,12019680,on our list well instead use this sorted,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,12068640,12154560,and we can see that our list is not,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,12191040,12276480,function doesnt sort the list in place,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,12231840,12319200,it returns a sorted version of the list,1,2
W8KRzm-HUcc,12276480,12354720,so to get that sorted list we have to,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,12507840,12588000,courses list and now if we copy that and,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,12622560,12685920,sorted version of that list so thats,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,12727200,12779040,list in any way,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,12800640,12867360,version of that list without altering,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,13093440,13179360,minimum value of our numbers list here,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,13341120,13412160,as the minimum number of that list,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,13412160,13502400,list then we could use max and if i run,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,13766880,13847040,values here within our list so let me go,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,14027040,14142720,and our list then we could just print,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,14335200,14412000,a value that doesnt exist in the list,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,14412000,14490720,search that original list of courses for,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,14525280,14605440,in the list now if we just wanted to,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,14605440,14685600,list and simply get back a true or false,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,14733120,14845440,in our list then i could say art in,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,15146880,15287520,of our list by using a for loop so if i,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,15552464,15651344,our list and each loop through this item,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,15651344,15724304,in the list so thats why this line is,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,15815040,15889424,that it prints out each item of our list,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,16901760,16972784,value as were looping through our list,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,17353440,17436944,well want to turn our list into strings,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,17500320,17564160,going to pass in our list as the,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,17564160,17636640,we wanted to turn our list of courses,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,17784000,17868944,our list so i want these to be comma,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,17948160,18038864,of the list using this string so ill,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,18518400,18583680,list values joined together now we can,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,18583680,18657120,string back into a list so we can do,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,18732480,18832320,new list here and ill set this equal to,1,2
W8KRzm-HUcc,18784320,18886560,the string version of our list and ill,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,19067040,19144320,space and make a list out of all those,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,19144320,19240160,out our new list so ill print,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,19202240,19278080,new list and run that and you can see,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,19240160,19316960,that now were back to the original list,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,19343840,19427840,can do with lists but now lets move on,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,19427840,19481120,familiar with lists then these will,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,19481120,19558400,okay so tuples are very similar to lists,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,19652000,19731680,lists are mutable and tuples are not,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,19954400,20037440,those in so first we have a regular list,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,20147840,20229440,our list of courses and im calling this,1,2
W8KRzm-HUcc,20186720,20274560,list one and then were creating another,1,2
W8KRzm-HUcc,20229440,20317760,variable here called list two and were,1,2
W8KRzm-HUcc,20274560,20360000,setting that equal to list one and then,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,20360000,20435360,run this then we can see that both list,1,2
W8KRzm-HUcc,20396960,20480000,one and list two have the same values so,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,20527040,20628320,index of list 1 and then reprinting our,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,20706080,20810720,list 1 but by changing list ones first,2,3
W8KRzm-HUcc,20761280,20837120,value it also changed list two and the,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,20885600,20972480,to modify your list then this mutability,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,20927840,21017120,is what you want but if you want a list,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,21222560,21297920,list but instead of the square brackets,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,21615200,21699200,these tuples are equal to the same list,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,21755360,21832160,one just like we did with our list if we,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,22013600,22088960,have nearly as many methods as a list,1,2
W8KRzm-HUcc,22052000,22126400,because a lot of those list methods that,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,22349600,22422560,for what mutates the list so thats,1,2
W8KRzm-HUcc,22390400,22457600,basically the difference between lists,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,22457600,22524320,you can modify then use a list but if,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,22927040,22998080,this looks similar to lists and tuples,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,23387840,23473600,our lists or tuples sets dont really,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,24076944,24159520,lists and tuples so what i mean by this,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,24325120,24412000,with lists and tuples also but sets are,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,26162560,26232160,performant than lists or tuples okay so,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,26299360,26367040,going to be how to create empty lists,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,26602704,26698704,so to create an empty list we can either,1,1
W8KRzm-HUcc,26698704,26783200,we can use this builtin list class and,1,1
W8KRzm-Hucc,27254080,27328000,working with lists and tuples and sets,1,1
Sx3I9hTsS80,36000,115200,the fnl list has been updated a lot of,1,1
Sx3I9hTsS80,221280,288464,because i havent seen the list its,1,1
Sx3I9hTsS80,562560,607680,think we were going to get a band list,1,1
Sx3I9hTsS80,692160,768000,list i believe this is the the eu page,1,1
Sx3I9hTsS80,8099040,8160960,the list i actually i dont really think,1,1
Sx3I9hTsS80,10446720,10499040,darkness could actually be on this list,1,1
Sx3I9hTsS80,11866080,11981760,freedom list oh my god theyve unbent so,1,1
Sx3I9hTsS80,12036000,12113264,contraband on the same list and now,1,1
Sx3I9hTsS80,16778864,16866240,list the very unlimited fucking necrons,1,1
Sx3I9hTsS80,17344784,17389920,banned list they got to give us arch we,1,1
Sx3I9hTsS80,17468624,17538240,on the list anymore the monarchs erupted,1,1
Sx3I9hTsS80,17538240,17634240,aether on the list and then we also have,1,1
Sx3I9hTsS80,17856000,17898704,one of the biggest band lists that weve,1,1
GaPS0EqVNJY,35520,109920,create a dynamic dropdown list a say,1,1
GaPS0EqVNJY,82560,157920,for example you wanted to create a list,1,2
GaPS0EqVNJY,109920,197584,when you chose one item from a list it,1,2
GaPS0EqVNJY,157920,240944,would give you a dynamic list from that,1,1
GaPS0EqVNJY,297600,370560,here in our produce list where the other,1,1
GaPS0EqVNJY,394560,459840,category it should give us the list of,1,1
GaPS0EqVNJY,533760,639360,us these for a list of these 4 items,1,1
GaPS0EqVNJY,1577264,1667520,the name for this list one way to do,1,1
GaPS0EqVNJY,3710240,3812000,do is win allow for a list and for our,1,1
GaPS0EqVNJY,4574080,4656640,a list but we just cant say that we,1,1
GaPS0EqVNJY,4828480,4912480,in this list or that list what we need,2,2
GaPS0EqVNJY,5350704,5439520,lists so thats what indirect is going,1,1
GaPS0EqVNJY,5918080,6006704,dropdown list hope this helps thanks,1,1
WgRAlgZaibI,7608480,7674704,or make a shopping list where im going,1,1
HdFG8L1sajw,559680,602400,and this data structure is list,1,1
HdFG8L1sajw,602400,623040,list is a common,1,1
HdFG8L1sajw,653600,713920,list is nothing but a collection of objects of the same type,1,1
HdFG8L1sajw,713920,773280,we can have a list of words we can have a list of names,2,2
HdFG8L1sajw,773280,804000,or we can have a list of numbers,1,1
HdFG8L1sajw,804000,873440,so let us first define list as an abstract data type so,1,1
HdFG8L1sajw,1050080,1091360,let us first define a very basic list,1,1
HdFG8L1sajw,1091360,1127520,i want a list that can store a,1,1
HdFG8L1sajw,1191200,1242720,this would be a static list as the number of elements in the list will not,2,2
HdFG8L1sajw,1242720,1308320,change and we will know the number of elements before creating the list,1,1
HdFG8L1sajw,1383360,1416320,any position in the list,1,1
HdFG8L1sajw,1468000,1481760,the list,1,1
HdFG8L1sajw,1481760,1542080,so if i ask you for an implementation of such a list,1,1
HdFG8L1sajw,1809280,1824000,list of,1,1
HdFG8L1sajw,2274544,2344304,so array is a data structure that gives us implementation for this list,1,1
HdFG8L1sajw,2344304,2419984,now i want a list and that should have many more features i want it to handle,1,1
HdFG8L1sajw,2444784,2480944,so ill redefine this list here,1,1
HdFG8L1sajw,2480944,2542400,i dont want a static list a static collection of fixed size i want a,1,1
HdFG8L1sajw,2542400,2563040,dynamic list,1,1
HdFG8L1sajw,2591984,2639664,so the features of my list are that,1,1
HdFG8L1sajw,2639664,2662880,i will call my list,1,1
HdFG8L1sajw,2684640,2714240,if there are no elements in the list,1,1
HdFG8L1sajw,2714240,2767184,ill say the size of the list is zero when it is empty,1,1
HdFG8L1sajw,2783824,2835664,i can insert an element into the list,1,1
HdFG8L1sajw,2835664,2894544,and i can insert an element at any position in the list in an existing,1,1
HdFG8L1sajw,2894544,2909744,list,1,1
HdFG8L1sajw,2909744,2950704,i can remove element from the list,1,1
HdFG8L1sajw,2950704,3005104,i can count the number of elements in the list,1,1
HdFG8L1sajw,3087200,3145744,element at a particular position in the list,1,1
HdFG8L1sajw,3145744,3211184,and i should also be able to specify the date type for the list so i should be,1,1
HdFG8L1sajw,3211184,3249920,able to while creating the list i should be,1,1
HdFG8L1sajw,3266240,3329424,whether this is a list of integers or whether this is a list of string,2,2
HdFG8L1sajw,3373104,3452304,now i want a data structure which is implementation of this dynamic list,1,1
HdFG8L1sajw,3479024,3553744,well actually we can implement such a dynamic list using arrays,1,1
HdFG8L1sajw,3671184,3738864,so let us see how we can implement this particular list using arrays,1,1
HdFG8L1sajw,3795680,3865280,that the data type for the list is integerso we are creating a list of,2,2
HdFG8L1sajw,3865280,3896304,a dynamic list of integers,1,1
HdFG8L1sajw,3896304,3955984,what we can do is to implement such a list we can declare,1,1
HdFG8L1sajw,4270704,4312624,that will mark the end of the list,1,1
HdFG8L1sajw,4332464,4374080,so if the list is empty we can,1,1
HdFG8L1sajw,4475840,4515360,so if end is minus one the list is empty,1,1
HdFG8L1sajw,4561760,4583200,array will store the list,1,1
HdFG8L1sajw,4583200,4626560,okay so lets say initially when the list is empty,1,1
HdFG8L1sajw,4911840,4946400,list towards the end of the list,2,2
HdFG8L1sajw,4946400,5011360,so the list will be like well have an element at position zero,1,1
HdFG8L1sajw,5102224,5164320,this variable end marks the end of the list in this array,1,1
HdFG8L1sajw,5193280,5237280,in the list at a particular position,1,1
HdFG8L1sajw,5547184,5607504,okay i just inserted some elements into the list let me also write the,1,1
HdFG8L1sajw,5905600,5958704,all these insertions this is what the list will look like,1,1
HdFG8L1sajw,5958704,6010224,this uh arrow here marks the end of the list in the array,1,1
HdFG8L1sajw,6638544,6707024,okay looks like we pretty much have an implementation of this uh list in the,1,1
HdFG8L1sajw,6762400,6816304,we have a logic of calling the list empty when we have,1,1
HdFG8L1sajw,6856944,6913904,we can insert element at the particular position in the list we can,1,1
HdFG8L1sajw,6997424,7032640,they can count the number of elements in the list,1,1
HdFG8L1sajw,7495184,7561104,but what is a good max size we can always exhaust the array the list can,1,1
HdFG8L1sajw,7632624,7704944,sowe need to have a strategy for the scenario when the list will,1,1
HdFG8L1sajw,9035680,9071200,that we have in the dynamic list,1,1
HdFG8L1sajw,9071200,9122560,the access to any element in this dynamic list,1,1
HdFG8L1sajw,9857744,9884800,uh end of the list,1,1

ohCDWZgNIU0,35840,141920,order matters and in python lists make it easy to work with ordered data lists are,2,2
ohCDWZgNIU0,212144,306720,sequence we will now learn how to create and use lists and we will do so in a linear,1,1
ohCDWZgNIU0,405760,455680,there are two ways to create a list one way,1,1
ohCDWZgNIU0,456304,552160,is to use the list constructor but a simpler and more common way is to use brackets,1,1
ohCDWZgNIU0,552160,637120,when creating a list you can also prepopulate it with values for example let___s create,1,1
ohCDWZgNIU0,637120,681440,a list with the first few prime numbers,1,1
ohCDWZgNIU0,749280,873120,new values to the end of the list let___s append the next two prime numbers 17___ and,1,1
ohCDWZgNIU0,911520,994400,if you display the list you will see it contains the new values notice how lists preserve,2,2
ohCDWZgNIU0,1092784,1188144,in lists order is everything you do not have to view the entire list if,2,2
ohCDWZgNIU0,1267200,1382864,you start counting with 0 not 1 so the elements in our list ___primes__ù are indexed 0 1,1,1
ohCDWZgNIU0,1509440,1599360,of the list and the index in brackets the first item is 2,1,1
ohCDWZgNIU0,1924144,2065600,get 1 here python wraps back around to the end of the list so the last item is 1,1,1
ohCDWZgNIU0,2156960,2238240,the values at the end of a list the last item is 19___,1,1
ohCDWZgNIU0,2292480,2347040,and we reach the beginning of the list with index 8,1,1
ohCDWZgNIU0,2503680,2535680,another way to access values in a list is,1,1
ohCDWZgNIU0,2536320,2617280,by slicing this lets you retrieve a range of values from your list,1,1
ohCDWZgNIU0,2617280,2669280,we will continue to use our list of primes,1,1
ohCDWZgNIU0,2669280,2776960,to slice this list type the name of the list bracket a starting index a colon a stopping,2,2
ohCDWZgNIU0,3360000,3409920,lists can contain more than prime numbers,1,1
ohCDWZgNIU0,3410880,3531680,they can contain integers___booleans___ strings___ floats___ and even other lists,1,1
ohCDWZgNIU0,3531680,3626880,many languages require lists to contain values of the same type but not python with python,1,1
ohCDWZgNIU0,3626880,3689600,you are free to insert multiple data types in the same list,1,1
ohCDWZgNIU0,3689600,3795200,lists can also contain duplicate values here is another way lists are different from sets,2,2
ohCDWZgNIU0,3882720,4048160,you roll a 4 7 2 7 12 4 and 7 if you look at the list all the values are,1,1
ohCDWZgNIU0,4106240,4152320,you can also combine lists to see how create,1,1
ohCDWZgNIU0,4152624,4200960,two separate lists a list of numbers___,2,1
ohCDWZgNIU0,4200960,4297760,and a list of letters___ to combine these two lists into a single list,3,3
ohCDWZgNIU0,4581920,4626704,combining lists is called ___concatenation__ù,1,1
ohCDWZgNIU0,4626704,4683360,observe the list of numbers,1,1
ohCDWZgNIU0,4683360,4719200,and the list of letters are unchanged,1,1
ohCDWZgNIU0,4778224,4849280,lists to see them all pass any list to the directory function,2,1
ohCDWZgNIU0,4930880,5018224,is a method for reversing a list the help text gives full details on what it does and,1,1
ohCDWZgNIU0,5086720,5143040,lists start at 0 and end___  they end precisely,1,1
ohCDWZgNIU0,5227360,5311840,them___ you can even clear them___ if i were to make a list of all the uses of lists i,2,2

tw7ror9x32s,39840,137280,introduce you to list in python the list,2,2
tw7ror9x32s,181920,257280,used to store a list of things and its,1,1
tw7ror9x32s,300464,392160,at one example here to define a list you,1,1
tw7ror9x32s,502560,641264,define a new list with the elements 3 10,1,1
tw7ror9x32s,570240,686384,and minus 1 and assign this list to this,1,1
tw7ror9x32s,1133280,1227360,list with the elements 3 10 and minus 1,1,1
tw7ror9x32s,1227360,1363664,list you can do that with a dot append,1,1
tw7ror9x32s,1363664,1452960,the number one to the list 8 so this dot,1,1
tw7ror9x32s,1562880,1675200,can use on the list datatype so again,1,1
tw7ror9x32s,1775520,1855664,to this list so one interesting thing,1,2
tw7ror9x32s,1812480,1890240,about the python list which is different,1,1
tw7ror9x32s,1890240,1982384,that you can mix types in a single list,1,2
tw7ror9x32s,1945440,2030880,so you could have a list containing,1,1
tw7ror9x32s,2053904,2129440,the string hello to the list a with a,1,1
tw7ror9x32s,2228800,2311824,cell and you see that this list now,1,1
tw7ror9x32s,2311824,2403040,numbers a list could even contain,1,2
tw7ror9x32s,2352640,2471520,another list so lets see how that works,1,1
tw7ror9x32s,2471520,2604640,2 so this means create a new list with,1,1
tw7ror9x32s,2604640,2700640,this list lets see how that looks with,1,1
tw7ror9x32s,2782240,2862880,is hello and another list within the,1,1
tw7ror9x32s,2826400,2896960,single list okay what if you wanted to,1,2
tw7ror9x32s,2862880,2938240,delete an item from this list for,1,1
tw7ror9x32s,3109104,3193600,predefined for the list datatype and,1,1
tw7ror9x32s,3367344,3447040,string but not the list because thats,1,1
tw7ror9x32s,3530080,3617920,the list of course and then lets print,1,1
tw7ror9x32s,3728784,3828640,the list data type but a pen and pop are,1,1
tw7ror9x32s,3861264,3937104,from this list for example the first,1,1
tw7ror9x32s,4047040,4146400,item from the list a with the index 0,1,1
tw7ror9x32s,4205440,4268800,first item in a list has the index 0 and,1,1
tw7ror9x32s,4580800,4688800,in the list but to keep it consistent,1,1
tw7ror9x32s,5090544,5192320,of this list so what if we wanted to,1,1
tw7ror9x32s,5303184,5387664,in the list and then you can assign a,1,1
tw7ror9x32s,5545584,5650224,that the first value of this list is 100,1,1
tw7ror9x32s,5722224,5815840,have a list with three strings inside so,1,1
tw7ror9x32s,5951184,6047664,the first value of this list whose index,1,1
tw7ror9x32s,6047664,6121584,this list before i show you my solution,1,1
tw7ror9x32s,6155184,6245440,list in python when you have b equals,1,1
tw7ror9x32s,7779040,7883680,have the desired result so thats a list,1,1
tw7ror9x32s,8041600,8140480,code first print the current lists with,1,1
tw7ror9x32s,8976800,9072800,the same list as the first one banana,1,1
tw7ror9x32s,9159200,9228800,within a list but dont worry too much,1,1

Z-h2UER3b_0,2373280,2436320,so names in name manager but data validation lists,1,1
Z-h2UER3b_0,2668640,2722720,i want my data preparation table to give me a list,1,1
Z-h2UER3b_0,3081600,3132480,and right here im gonna see a list of customers,1,1
Z-h2UER3b_0,3387360,3413280,actually its gonna be the full list,1,1
Z-h2UER3b_0,5148160,5228160,that can filter this list and just give us the trues back,1,1
Z-h2UER3b_0,5412960,5448160,we want to see a list of customer names,1,1
Z-h2UER3b_0,5840800,5892800,okay so when we type in rob we get the list of names,1,1
Z-h2UER3b_0,6350240,6398400,and i get my data validation preparation list,1,1
Z-h2UER3b_0,6443680,6495040,notice that my customer list here is a list,2,2
Z-h2UER3b_0,6576000,6640480,mentioned a few times you wanna get the unique list back,1,1
Z-h2UER3b_0,6761280,6814400,because i have a list of unique values here,1,1
Z-h2UER3b_0,7151360,7198720,im gonna select list for source,1,1
Z-h2UER3b_0,7404640,7456000,so when i click this i get the list of names,1,1
Z-h2UER3b_0,7684000,7735040,right because it doesnt find rob in that list,1,1
Z-h2UER3b_0,8022080,8059680,my data preparation list updates,1,1
Z-h2UER3b_0,8059680,8097760,so does my data validation list,1,1

WwfhLC16bis,30720,78320,im gonna give you a quick introduction to linked list,1,1
WwfhLC16bis,124240,166000,the very basic of linked lists but ill cover more,1,1
WwfhLC16bis,166000,213680,advanced topics in a later video now a linked lists is,1,1
WwfhLC16bis,551120,595760,and a linked list can be visualzed as,1,1
WwfhLC16bis,644400,683760,and the difference between an array and a linked list,1,1
WwfhLC16bis,731920,778160,but lets first focus on how a linked list,1,1

njTh_OwMljA,58544,128160,were going to talk about linked lists a linked list is a very simple data structure,2,2
njTh_OwMljA,196800,259184,element which links the next element a linked list can contain pretty much any,1,1
njTh_OwMljA,434400,494400,that distinguishes a linked list from an array which shares many of the same,1,1
njTh_OwMljA,582240,662880,to the fourth element you can just boom instantly do that in a linked list,1,0
njTh_OwMljA,828000,903360,would anyone use such a data structure well the advantage of a linked list is,1,1
njTh_OwMljA,988320,1051664,element right to the beginning of the linked list that can be done in constant,1,1
njTh_OwMljA,1051664,1122240,time if you want to delete an element from the beginning of the linked list again,1,1
njTh_OwMljA,1184160,1246544,of course if you want to append an element to the end of the linked list,1,0
njTh_OwMljA,1246544,1322880,that might require walking all the way through the linked list until you get,1,2
njTh_OwMljA,1506240,1591664,and that is this alternate version called a doubly linked list a doubly,1,1
njTh_OwMljA,1591664,1663200,linked list is just like a singly linked list but in addition to each element,2,2
njTh_OwMljA,1835520,1901760,of a linked list lets take a look at what the code would look like implementing,1,1
njTh_OwMljA,1901760,1935840,a linked list is reasonably straightforward,1,1
njTh_OwMljA,2402400,2469600,at the current node so the head of the linked list and then its going,1,1
njTh_OwMljA,2469600,2530080,to walk through the linked list until we get to the end of the linked list,2,1
njTh_OwMljA,2542080,2590080,well how do we know that were not at the end of the linked list,1,1
njTh_OwMljA,2599200,2653440,well were not at the end of the linked list as long as theres something after,1,1
njTh_OwMljA,2755680,2809440,end of the linked list then when we get down to the end of the linked list,2,1
njTh_OwMljA,3302400,3414720,define a class linked list thats basically going to wrap our head and,1,1
njTh_OwMljA,3474720,3542400,beginning which is in this linked list class lets just update this because the,1,1
njTh_OwMljA,4930880,5000480,going to walk through the linked list and its going to stop one,1,1
njTh_OwMljA,5272144,5350880,so first well have this little current method that walks through the linked list,1,0
njTh_OwMljA,5446880,5481440,we dont want to run off the edge of the linked list,1,1
njTh_OwMljA,6449760,6559680,head dot next that is just cut me out of the linked list now lets take a look at,1,1
njTh_OwMljA,6808320,6895200,the linked list starting at the head value then as long as walk up until,1,1
njTh_OwMljA,7070880,7159680,otherwise we continue walking through the linked list so those are the basic,1,1
njTh_OwMljA,7243200,7308960,list now that youve seen the basic operations why dont you give it a shot on a,1,1
njTh_OwMljA,7308960,7328640,new linked list problem,1,1

BJ5Yt-WoswM,5031360,5105280,depends on the station list if he needs,1,1
BJ5Yt-WoswM,7350224,7425120,well also look at for this list i think,1,1
BJ5Yt-WoswM,8121584,8190224,this list for example he has et phrasing,1,1
hdIsKTKeQt4,493904,580320,lists or acls and thats what were,1,1
hdIsKTKeQt4,580320,660480,exactly we can use the access list for,1,1
hdIsKTKeQt4,660480,726720,lists work after that well discuss what,1,2
hdIsKTKeQt4,703200,764624,are the different types of access list,1,1
hdIsKTKeQt4,764624,853440,lists well it is said that there are two,1,1
hdIsKTKeQt4,809760,900944,main uses of access list the first one,1,1
hdIsKTKeQt4,900944,962880,that access lists can block traffic that,1,1
hdIsKTKeQt4,1484144,1557600,coming in the access list checks that,1,1
hdIsKTKeQt4,1805760,1879200,list is classification and basically,1,0
hdIsKTKeQt4,2078864,2146560,a more common use today for access list,1,1
hdIsKTKeQt4,2146560,2217120,for example we have an access list that,1,1
hdIsKTKeQt4,2455680,2537760,marked a special body access list so if,1,1
hdIsKTKeQt4,2563680,2627040,marked as special by the access list the,1,1
hdIsKTKeQt4,2967840,3036480,access list now realizes the district is,1,1
hdIsKTKeQt4,3349440,3402720,list only marks traffic that is going,1,1
hdIsKTKeQt4,3402720,3502080,specifically access list can also be,1,1
hdIsKTKeQt4,3670080,3739200,access list for classification more than,1,1
hdIsKTKeQt4,3829760,3908160,access lists works on the routers,1,1
hdIsKTKeQt4,4055040,4134704,inbound or outbound access lists inbound,1,1
hdIsKTKeQt4,4107344,4161600,access lists are said to fill the,1,1
hdIsKTKeQt4,4568320,4642720,access list also theres a slight,1,1
hdIsKTKeQt4,4747360,4823200,an inbound access list the traffic is,1,1
hdIsKTKeQt4,4912000,4987360,an album access list we is used when the,1,1
hdIsKTKeQt4,5159680,5238880,the access list so you might argue that,1,1
hdIsKTKeQt4,5307040,5382880,list because what is the point of,1,1
hdIsKTKeQt4,5440480,5519200,blocked by an access list anyways but,1,1
hdIsKTKeQt4,5592160,5656000,list depending on what criteria do they,1,0
hdIsKTKeQt4,5656000,5729760,of traffic the two types of access lists,1,2
hdIsKTKeQt4,5698720,5772640,are standard and extended access list,1,2
hdIsKTKeQt4,5729760,5833120,standard access lists are set to check,1,1
hdIsKTKeQt4,6005440,6081760,extended access list they check where,1,1
hdIsKTKeQt4,6195520,6281440,extended access list can specify that,1,1
hdIsKTKeQt4,6342880,6413920,where a standard access list cannot do,1,1
hdIsKTKeQt4,6854560,6923184,standard access list will have cs,1,1
hdIsKTKeQt4,6923184,6994224,access list we would have to use the,1,1
hdIsKTKeQt4,7042560,7117600,meaning we can call an access list junk,1,1
hdIsKTKeQt4,7199664,7284160,the named access list is standard or,1,1
hdIsKTKeQt4,7284160,7353280,standard named access list would have to,1,1
hdIsKTKeQt4,7391664,7481440,list will have to type extended plus,1,1
hdIsKTKeQt4,7591840,7666224,access list is constructed of access,1,2
hdIsKTKeQt4,7628800,7706080,list statement each statement has a,1,1
hdIsKTKeQt4,8004624,8064160,the ax lists keep the checking of the,1,1
hdIsKTKeQt4,8064160,8145280,list and thats whatever the access list,2,1
hdIsKTKeQt4,8247504,8348320,accesses statement the access list will,1,1
hdIsKTKeQt4,8561280,8649600,we have a standard numbered access list,1,1
hdIsKTKeQt4,8988960,9074880,checked against an outbound access list,1,1
hdIsKTKeQt4,9026400,9100320,15 since this is a standard access list,1,1
hdIsKTKeQt4,9305280,9383040,a match so that means that the acts list,1,1
hdIsKTKeQt4,10161120,10237920,the access list will never go to the,1,1
hdIsKTKeQt4,10488960,10565280,an extended access list as you remember,1,1

195KUinjBpU,28320,113280,tutorial on late lists and how they are,1,1
195KUinjBpU,247680,315840,completely understand linked lists so,1,1
195KUinjBpU,315840,383024,list well first what you have to,1,1
195KUinjBpU,473280,587504,list and the linked list is just another,2,1
195KUinjBpU,587504,691200,one of the links in the linked list and,1,1
195KUinjBpU,826560,945600,his name is linked list and he is just a,1,1
195KUinjBpU,945600,1040640,the links in the linked list he only has,1,1
195KUinjBpU,1110720,1203840,list that guy is going to be named first,1,1
195KUinjBpU,1203840,1294080,of a field inside of linked list first,1,1
195KUinjBpU,1523520,1607024,in before him to the list and so forth,1,2
195KUinjBpU,1561440,1661760,and so on so if the length list class,1,1
195KUinjBpU,1789440,1866720,provide it to the linked list and that,1,1
195KUinjBpU,1895024,1982384,linked lists and make this all clear,1,1
195KUinjBpU,1982384,2078864,going to create a linked list group of,1,1
195KUinjBpU,2383200,2464320,list and like you saw before that guy of,1,1
195KUinjBpU,2676480,2740320,like i said linked lists are confusing,1,1
195KUinjBpU,3150720,3219360,list just having data inside of it and,1,1
195KUinjBpU,3257280,3333600,link that was added to our linked list,1,1
195KUinjBpU,3627344,3693120,name is link list and like you saw,1,1
195KUinjBpU,3759344,3826560,list or the last link that was added to,1,2
195KUinjBpU,3800160,3874560,the linked list now were just going to,1,2
195KUinjBpU,3826560,3918720,go to link list and im going to put in,1,1
195KUinjBpU,3986400,4047344,value when you create a linked list so,1,1
195KUinjBpU,4114560,4201440,want to check if my linked list is empty,1,1
195KUinjBpU,4385440,4450224,list to insert a new link into our,1,2
195KUinjBpU,4420960,4504000,linked list a new link needs to be,1,1
195KUinjBpU,4567840,4642224,length lists first link field is,1,1
195KUinjBpU,4733920,4816000,to our linked list were going to take,1,1
195KUinjBpU,4816000,4901920,linked list store that inside of next,1,1
195KUinjBpU,5034400,5086704,linked list knows about the newest guy,1,1
195KUinjBpU,5734224,5831664,of the link list to the new link so i go,1,1
195KUinjBpU,6026080,6108624,linked list so now lets look at how to,1,1
195KUinjBpU,6160464,6231504,into town the length lists a first link,1,1
195KUinjBpU,6942880,7015360,coding inside of our linked list that we,1,1
195KUinjBpU,7115184,7192480,gonna remove the link from our list by,1,1
195KUinjBpU,7381584,7455520,list and then remember we said that we,1,1
195KUinjBpU,7512144,7583664,so how do we cycle through a linked list,1,1
195KUinjBpU,7583664,7667664,cycle through a list of links is start,1,1
195KUinjBpU,7667664,7738704,remember linked list knows about the,1,1
195KUinjBpU,7911504,7984960,inside the linked list object and then,1,1
195KUinjBpU,8488960,8539840,the list and we are done cycling through,1,1
195KUinjBpU,9683200,9750400,in a linked list well were going to,1,1
195KUinjBpU,9750400,9824320,reference stored in the linked list and,1,1
195KUinjBpU,9978880,10062400,the end of the list of links or in other,1,1
195KUinjBpU,10062400,10125760,inside a length list do you match what,1,1
195KUinjBpU,10243840,10311520,list which means null and were going to,1,1
195KUinjBpU,10888960,10970560,list and how do we know were at the end,1,2
195KUinjBpU,10924480,11004160,of our linked list well next is going to,1,1
195KUinjBpU,11047840,11097280,end of the list without finding a match,1,1
195KUinjBpU,11183200,11248480,matching link inside the linked list,1,1
195KUinjBpU,11351200,11454400,say empty linked list print that out on,1,1
195KUinjBpU,11705440,11780800,linked lists first link matches were,1,1
195KUinjBpU,13362880,13441600,inside the length list which means there,1,1
195KUinjBpU,13632160,13708960,next link inside of our linked list so,1,1
195KUinjBpU,14205760,14285424,link inside of linked lists so its very,1,1
195KUinjBpU,14882080,14933440,list,1,2
195KUinjBpU,14891680,14976640,new linked list is equal to new linked,1,2
195KUinjBpU,14933440,15017920,list and then if we want to insert new,1,1
195KUinjBpU,15276640,15356800,to our linked list now if we want to,1,2
195KUinjBpU,15311680,15390880,display our linked list quite easy just,1,1
195KUinjBpU,15603040,15674080,of the linked list and harry potter in,1,1
195KUinjBpU,16072960,16184800,list and do a find on the lord of the,1,1
195KUinjBpU,16783360,16844800,linked lists i hope you completely,1,1
ZdY1Fp9dKzs,729264,788944,is that we can create two list one,1,1
ZdY1Fp9dKzs,853424,904800,edges for a list we can use an array,1,1
ZdY1Fp9dKzs,969104,1033600,a dynamic list infact we can use a dynamic list,2,2
ZdY1Fp9dKzs,1199024,1259200,its name so the first list the list of vertices,2,2
ZdY1Fp9dKzs,1259200,1319840,would simply be a list of names or strings,1,1
ZdY1Fp9dKzs,1422880,1475664,in this edge list here an edge,1,1
ZdY1Fp9dKzs,1791664,1883504,edge list would basically be an array or list of this type,2,2
ZdY1Fp9dKzs,2481264,2550224,now lets fill this edge list here for this example graph,1,1
ZdY1Fp9dKzs,4877440,4938720,we can simply create two lists one to store the vertices,1,1
ZdY1Fp9dKzs,6219040,6302240,for the first list the vertex list least number of rows needed,2,2
ZdY1Fp9dKzs,6400960,6453440,each row here in this vertex list is a name or,1,1
ZdY1Fp9dKzs,7000800,7068960,are of different lengths so all rows in vertex list or,1,1
ZdY1Fp9dKzs,7068960,7134064,all rows in edge list would not cost us same,1,1
ZdY1Fp9dKzs,7437920,7491360,then the total space consumed in this vertex list,1,1
ZdY1Fp9dKzs,7828464,7877584,now for the edge list once again,1,1
ZdY1Fp9dKzs,8193120,8249424,references or pointers to the names in the vertex list,1,1
ZdY1Fp9dKzs,8707040,8732800,string in vertex list,1,1
ZdY1Fp9dKzs,8732800,8817600,lets say a is at index 0 in vertex list and b is that index 1 and,1,1
ZdY1Fp9dKzs,9118560,9204144,are of type int now and in each row of edge list first and second field,1,1
ZdY1Fp9dKzs,9344304,9401760,and if you can see now each row in edge list,1,1
ZdY1Fp9dKzs,9401760,9494224,would cost us the same amount of memory so overall space consumed in edge list,1,1
ZdY1Fp9dKzs,10449920,10517424,well we will have to scan the whole edge list we will have to perform,1,1
ZdY1Fp9dKzs,10577120,10658080,in the list and see if the start or end node in the entry is our given node,1,1
ZdY1Fp9dKzs,11150080,11216800,a linear search on the edge list in worst case we will have to look at,1,1
ZdY1Fp9dKzs,11216800,11295360,all the entries in the edge list so worstcase running time would be,1,1
ZdY1Fp9dKzs,12833424,12908160,all in all this vertex list and edge list kind of the representation,2,2

lC-yYCOnN8Q,7200,98704,in our previous lesson we introduced you to linked list data structure and we saw how,1,1
lC-yYCOnN8Q,98704,179360,linked lists solve some of the problems that we have with arrays,1,1
lC-yYCOnN8Q,179360,276960,so now the obvious question would be which one is better  an array or a linked list,1,1
lC-yYCOnN8Q,1007200,1030080,a linked list,1,1
lC-yYCOnN8Q,1030080,1124480,so i will draw two columns here one for array and another for linked list and the,1,1
lC-yYCOnN8Q,2560160,2649440,now in a linked list data is not stored in a contiguous block of memory,1,1
lC-yYCOnN8Q,2649440,2739200,so if we have a linked list something like this lets say we have a linked list of integers,2,2
lC-yYCOnN8Q,2821440,2921760,each block in the linked list is called a node and each node has two fields one to,1,1
lC-yYCOnN8Q,3049440,3150720,the only information that we keep with us about a linked list is the address of the,1,1
lC-yYCOnN8Q,3291360,3371824,access an element in the linked list at a particular position we first need to start,1,1
lC-yYCOnN8Q,3515200,3572640,in the worst case to access the last element in the list we,1,1
lC-yYCOnN8Q,3572640,3616960,will be traversing all the elements in the list,1,1
lC-yYCOnN8Q,3680304,3784320,so if n is the size of he linked list n is the number of elements in the linked list,2,2
lC-yYCOnN8Q,3914544,3937584,in the linked list,1,1
lC-yYCOnN8Q,4060304,4139520,cost of accessing an element array scores heavily over linked list,1,1
lC-yYCOnN8Q,4139520,4213440,so iif you have a requirement where you want to access elements in the list all the time,1,1
lC-yYCOnN8Q,4640160,4747200,array stores our list and some part of the array is vacant or empty so that we can add,1,1
lC-yYCOnN8Q,4747200,4772480,more elements in the list,1,1
lC-yYCOnN8Q,4772480,4870080,for example we have an array of 7 integers here and we have only 3 integers in the list,1,1
lC-yYCOnN8Q,4975040,5060960,with linked list lets say we have lets say we have this linked list of integers,2,2
lC-yYCOnN8Q,5303520,5357760,variable in a linked list can not be ignored,1,1
lC-yYCOnN8Q,5592480,5695520,and the memory requirement for this linked list would be 83 where 8 is the size of,1,1
lC-yYCOnN8Q,5816960,5907040,if we add one more element to the list in the array we will just use one more position,1,1
lC-yYCOnN8Q,5907040,5994560,while in linked list we will create one more node and will take another 8 bytes so this,1,1
lC-yYCOnN8Q,6044800,6144960,linked list would fetch us a lot of advantage if the data the data part is large in size,1,1
lC-yYCOnN8Q,6144960,6236960,so in this case we had a linked list if integers so integer is only 4 bytes,1,1
lC-yYCOnN8Q,6236960,6360480,what if we had a linked list in which the data part was some complex type that took,1,1
lC-yYCOnN8Q,6601280,6711360,and linked list of 4 would be only 80 bytes,1,1
lC-yYCOnN8Q,6740320,6834400,if the data part of a list takes a lot of memory linked list will definitely consume,2,2
lC-yYCOnN8Q,7197456,7299040,may be memory may not be available as one large block but if we are using linked list,1,2
lC-yYCOnN8Q,7573600,7660960,so this is also where linked list scores,1,1
lC-yYCOnN8Q,7896480,7976480,so this is also one cost which is not there with linked list,1,1
lC-yYCOnN8Q,8285280,8301280,list,1,1
lC-yYCOnN8Q,8366880,8418080,use of array as dynamic list,1,1
lC-yYCOnN8Q,8469120,8568320,first scenario will be when we want to insert an element at the beginning of the list,1,1
lC-yYCOnN8Q,8568320,8628000,lets see we want to insert number 3 at the beginning of the list,1,1
lC-yYCOnN8Q,8735680,8795680,so the time taken will be proportional to the size of the list,1,1
lC-yYCOnN8Q,8838880,8868960,lets say n is the size of the list,1,1
lC-yYCOnN8Q,8922880,9017120,in the case of linked list inserting a node in the beginning will mean only creating a,1,1
lC-yYCOnN8Q,9108960,9185760,so the time taken will not depend upon the size of the list it will be constant,1,1
lC-yYCOnN8Q,9185760,9270880,so for linked list inserting an element at the beginning is o in terms of time,1,1
lC-yYCOnN8Q,9386400,9473600,a dynamic list in which we create a new array if it gets filled,1,1
lC-yYCOnN8Q,9473600,9574400,if there is space in the array we just write to the next higher index of the list,1,1
lC-yYCOnN8Q,9731680,9803520,into new array which will take o time where n is the size of the list,1,1
lC-yYCOnN8Q,9803520,9887360,in the case of linked list adding an element inserting an element in the end will mean,1,1
lC-yYCOnN8Q,9887360,9980000,traversing the whole list and then creating a new node and adjusting the links,1,1
lC-yYCOnN8Q,10021120,10098400,i will use this color coding for linked list,1,1
lC-yYCOnN8Q,10098400,10140800,here n is the number of elements in the list,1,1
lC-yYCOnN8Q,10140800,10240160,now the third case will be when we want to insert in the middle of the list at soem nth,1,1
lC-yYCOnN8Q,10435680,10525280,so will have to shift n2 where n is the number of elements in the list,1,1
lC-yYCOnN8Q,10651040,10733120,for linked list also we will have to traverse till that position and then only we can adjust,1,1
lC-yYCOnN8Q,11333600,11436464,linked list implemetation especially in cor c is more prone to errors like segmentation,1,1
lC-yYCOnN8Q,11465920,11515360,it takes good care to work with linked lists,1,1
lC-yYCOnN8Q,11515360,11568464,so this was arrays vs linked lists,1,1
lC-yYCOnN8Q,11568464,11645440,in our next lesson we will implement linked list in c or c,1,1

SfrDdkZZCzM,213120,276000,talk about cisco router access lists,1,1
SfrDdkZZCzM,336000,403184,like standard access control lists and,1,1

MFOAbpfrJ8g,426240,481440,on itself not necessarily to the beginning of the linked list but,1,1
MFOAbpfrJ8g,481440,559680,somewhere in the linked list so one way of solving it is that you walk through,1,1
MFOAbpfrJ8g,559680,636480,the linked list and you mark each node and if youve seen if you get,1,1
MFOAbpfrJ8g,697920,777120,great technique if you can modify the linked list but if you cant that wont,1,1
MFOAbpfrJ8g,832800,906720,imagine the linked list was like a racetrack and youre driving around it,1,1
MFOAbpfrJ8g,906720,979184,well one way you know that you have a link a loop in the in the list is if youve,1,1
MFOAbpfrJ8g,1331024,1386720,linked list so we can have two pointers moving through the linked list at,2,2
MFOAbpfrJ8g,1554240,1610880,one will one or both of them eventually will get to the end of the linked list,1,1
MFOAbpfrJ8g,2144000,2296160,head of the linked list now we want to move through the linked list so while fast is,2,2
MFOAbpfrJ8g,4984960,5010880,on other linked list questions,1,1
6RlB4wVO2mw,658560,718064,basically that theres a list of,1,1

6RlB4wVO2mw,3189600,3278400,add one more reminder to the list thats,1,1
6RlB4wVO2mw,3427200,3509264,file name selected in the list below and,1,1
6RlB4wVO2mw,4275840,4386704,and the list because the items on the,1,2

6RlB4wVO2mw,4453440,4529760,the list so say for example that one if,1,1
6RlB4wVO2mw,4587840,4654080,little moves at the top of the list and,1,1
6RlB4wVO2mw,4904144,4975184,and also to move items on the list up,1,1
6RlB4wVO2mw,4975184,5046704,into the completed items list so,1,1
6RlB4wVO2mw,5190704,5238704,here which is the list of reminders,1,1
6RlB4wVO2mw,5400000,5466704,items list which is available on the,1,2

6RlB4wVO2mw,5500800,5595840,see heres the list of active files so,1,1
6RlB4wVO2mw,5702880,5774880,the file list over here youll see that,1,1
6RlB4wVO2mw,5868000,5932320,list say the file settled or for some,1,1
6RlB4wVO2mw,6068624,6150704,reminder list over here so the best,1,1
6RlB4wVO2mw,6322544,6391184,on the list of reminders the one is sort,1,1
6RlB4wVO2mw,6960480,7020960,files really on the file list you simply,1,1

pBrz9HmjFOs,20160,78720,the linked list data structure but were,1,1
pBrz9HmjFOs,78720,144944,representing a contact list so the type,1,2
pBrz9HmjFOs,110880,187200,of contact list you would find in your,1,2
pBrz9HmjFOs,144944,216480,cell phone has just a list of names and,1,1
pBrz9HmjFOs,286080,364304,contact list were only going to keep,1,1
pBrz9HmjFOs,364304,419024,instead of using a linked list which is,1,1
pBrz9HmjFOs,1096320,1173120,typically contacts lists will either be,1,1
pBrz9HmjFOs,3140784,3220480,is what we call the link list so let me,1,1
pBrz9HmjFOs,3276160,3349104,structure to represent our contact list,1,1
pBrz9HmjFOs,3385104,3460960,our linked list so this linked list data,2,2
pBrz9HmjFOs,3908784,3983680,this same exact contact list we had down,1,1
pBrz9HmjFOs,3983680,4047520,represent it with a linked list now the,1,1
pBrz9HmjFOs,4110080,4183040,lists is that we have whats called a,1,1
pBrz9HmjFOs,4407200,4501600,and tom so that we have a linked list,1,1
pBrz9HmjFOs,4570224,4649440,so now we have our linked list structure,1,2
pBrz9HmjFOs,4860144,4913440,so with this linked list structure the,1,1
pBrz9HmjFOs,5150064,5216320,linked list so these nodes could be very,1,1
pBrz9HmjFOs,5628624,5691040,list so thats basically how we go about,1,2
pBrz9HmjFOs,5664624,5715504,traversing our linked list is by,1,1
pBrz9HmjFOs,5827360,5908960,the list so this tom node here is our,1,2
pBrz9HmjFOs,5860464,5951184,very last node in our linked list and we,1,1
pBrz9HmjFOs,5976624,6048144,hey this is the end of our list so what,1,1
pBrz9HmjFOs,6238224,6300144,particular contact list that we have,1,2
pBrz9HmjFOs,6273280,6345280,represented with linked list im going,1,1
pBrz9HmjFOs,6482544,6548800,lists is to get bob in the correct,1,1
pBrz9HmjFOs,6581424,6653920,have to do with a linked list is take,1,1
pBrz9HmjFOs,7052800,7098400,matter in the case of the link list so,1,2
pBrz9HmjFOs,7076800,7139680,in the linked list we could have had a,1,1
pBrz9HmjFOs,7783360,7854400,linked lists versus the vector the,1,2
pBrz9HmjFOs,7825120,7886080,linked list is very good doing,1,1
pBrz9HmjFOs,7995040,8058880,our linked list it still takes the same,1,1
pBrz9HmjFOs,8758720,8836480,of the linked list we would have to,1,1
pBrz9HmjFOs,9296800,9360640,binary search with linked lists because,1,1
pBrz9HmjFOs,9379840,9438400,depending on what kind of linked list,1,2
pBrz9HmjFOs,9410080,9481600,you have in the linked list that we have,1,2
pBrz9HmjFOs,9481600,9544000,forward through our list now there is,1,2
pBrz9HmjFOs,9508960,9573280,other types of linked list called doubly,1,2
pBrz9HmjFOs,9544000,9598720,linked lists in which we could actually,1,1
pBrz9HmjFOs,9598720,9661600,list and traverse this way but we would,1,1
pBrz9HmjFOs,9699520,9779680,with a linked list is when we go ahead,1,1
pBrz9HmjFOs,9865120,9934720,of the linked list then we have no,1,1
pBrz9HmjFOs,9934720,10002880,anywhere in our list we have to have,1,1
pBrz9HmjFOs,10452160,10516000,would have a linked list class that,1,1
pBrz9HmjFOs,10615840,10661440,your list so we may have one of those,1,1
pBrz9HmjFOs,10704640,10792480,also the the linked list class itself in,1,1
pBrz9HmjFOs,10924960,10976304,node to the linked list or deleting a,1,1
pBrz9HmjFOs,10976304,11052640,list finding a particular node in your,1,2
pBrz9HmjFOs,11018064,11080464,linked list so all the operations,1,2
pBrz9HmjFOs,11052640,11116464,associated with a linked list would be,1,1
pBrz9HmjFOs,11163984,11220144,associated with this linked list,1,1
pBrz9HmjFOs,11187984,11251824,structure so we think of a linked list,1,1
pBrz9HmjFOs,11574864,11642560,were at the end of this list,1,1
pBrz9HmjFOs,11901760,11958864,linked list its really good at,1,1
pBrz9HmjFOs,12167680,12242560,where the linked list is week is in,1,1
pBrz9HmjFOs,12353424,12407184,linked list thats not the case requires,1,1
pBrz9HmjFOs,12621760,12684144,applications of the linked list its,1,1

yRzO7OAV5X0,660480,683040,as a todo list,1,1
yRzO7OAV5X0,714880,762560,the very best todo list available,1,1
yRzO7OAV5X0,806240,854080,as a powerful todo list,1,1
yRzO7OAV5X0,944480,993280,with a traditional todo list app very long,1,1
yRzO7OAV5X0,1136480,1187360,there is a large number of todo list apps,1,1
yRzO7OAV5X0,1317920,1348480,and then we just try the next one on that list,1,1
yRzO7OAV5X0,1524320,1549920,as your todo list,1,1
yRzO7OAV5X0,1624160,1662080,without cluttering up our todo list,1,1
yRzO7OAV5X0,1988000,2033280,on many traditional todo list apps,1,1
yRzO7OAV5X0,2121600,2158448,to our trello todo list,1,1
yRzO7OAV5X0,3479360,3516000,so todo list apps,1,1
yRzO7OAV5X0,3566560,3610080,of the number of todo list apps,1,1
yRzO7OAV5X0,3745600,3774080,or a todo list app,1,1
yRzO7OAV5X0,3965600,4000480,of todo list apps,1,1
yRzO7OAV5X0,4421600,4474400,are really quite powerful as a todo list,1,1
yRzO7OAV5X0,4863200,4909440,are not necessarily todo list apps,1,1
yRzO7OAV5X0,5128640,5160128,are not really a todo list app,1,1
yRzO7OAV5X0,5622880,5668000,some basic todo list functionality,1,1
yRzO7OAV5X0,5812640,5826720,as a todo list,1,1
yRzO7OAV5X0,5826720,5899840,so i thought id add them here on this list,1,1
yRzO7OAV5X0,7236640,7279840,and most todo list apps dont allow you,1,1
yRzO7OAV5X0,7408800,7452000,another problem of most todo list apps is that,1,1
yRzO7OAV5X0,7662880,7699520,but often todo list apps leave them,1,1
yRzO7OAV5X0,8381280,8435840,and this is where many todo list apps fail,1,1
yRzO7OAV5X0,8500800,8534560,in todo list apps,1,1
yRzO7OAV5X0,8805600,8846080,many todo list apps have an important,1,1
yRzO7OAV5X0,9516480,9570720,the best todo list app out there,1,1
yRzO7OAV5X0,10445280,10475840,and add lists and so forth,1,1
yRzO7OAV5X0,10547520,10596320,through the lens of a todo list,1,1
yRzO7OAV5X0,10641280,10671040,ive got my first list,1,1
yRzO7OAV5X0,10752640,10785760,of these lists as you would like,1,1
yRzO7OAV5X0,10914560,10929280,beyond lists,1,1
yRzO7OAV5X0,11283680,11324800,if not all of the standard things that a todo list can,1,1
yRzO7OAV5X0,12270880,12328640,our todo list even more by adding more lists,2,2
yRzO7OAV5X0,12328640,12397760,so im going to add a projects list,1,1
yRzO7OAV5X0,12425920,12480480,most todo lists will not allow you to do this,1,1
yRzO7OAV5X0,12480480,12522240,you may be able to manage a few different lists,1,1
yRzO7OAV5X0,13815040,13845120,and then go into the projects list,1,1
yRzO7OAV5X0,13962880,14005120,and add additional lists,1,1
yRzO7OAV5X0,14052000,14090880,or an ideas list,1,1
yRzO7OAV5X0,14090880,14119200,so this would be a list where,1,1
yRzO7OAV5X0,14601120,14640480,im just gonna rearrange some of these lists,1,1
yRzO7OAV5X0,14764640,14787360,your todo list,1,1
yRzO7OAV5X0,14787360,14844800,so maybe things start in the notes or ideas list,1,1
yRzO7OAV5X0,15222880,15256160,now of course you can add multiple lists,1,1
yRzO7OAV5X0,15256160,15336160,ive seen some people prefer having a todo future list,1,1
yRzO7OAV5X0,15337600,15381440,so how that would work is that maybe this list,1,1
yRzO7OAV5X0,15381440,15414400,the todo list is for today,1,1
yRzO7OAV5X0,15571360,15601280,well then maybe ill go to this list,1,1

DyG9S9nAlUM,960,72000,when alex did a video on linked list theres a lot of comments on it it sort of thing,1,1
DyG9S9nAlUM,72000,110864,i want to use a linked list arrays a factor,1,1
DyG9S9nAlUM,177600,251840,faster than the linked list or are the linked lists faster than an array how do we go about finding out,2,2
DyG9S9nAlUM,251840,315200,which ones faster so lets have a shoot out arrays versus linked list,1,1
DyG9S9nAlUM,373760,421760,i should just remind ourselves what the difference is between a linked list and,1,1
DyG9S9nAlUM,1695840,1762400,linked list works slightly different we start off at the beginning of,1,1
DyG9S9nAlUM,1770720,1836784,the linked list and it points at nothing but then as we add things to the list we,2,2
DyG9S9nAlUM,3049920,3091040,so you can then walk through your list,1,0
DyG9S9nAlUM,4033744,4129744,its got an integer called p and an integer called q so saving the linked list and in,1,1
DyG9S9nAlUM,4235840,4336160,or all the elements in our linked list and sum the value of p are going to add up all the value,1,1
DyG9S9nAlUM,4445760,4496480,somethings going to add them all up well do the same with the linked list as well,1,1
DyG9S9nAlUM,4743840,4828640,that its going to visit every single element in either the array or every single element in the linked list,1,0
DyG9S9nAlUM,5412320,5476624,im going to go over an array of values and a linked list of values,1,1
DyG9S9nAlUM,5790240,5911024,or mailing list and in the linked list ive got a structure which contains an integer p and an integer q and,2,2
DyG9S9nAlUM,6015840,6100640,the only difference is that the linked list has one extra item which is the next pointer to the next thing,1,1
DyG9S9nAlUM,6283200,6332464,list or an array of random number generator,1,1
DyG9S9nAlUM,6432000,6499040,so allocate memory for each element in the linked list and then we set the value,1,1
DyG9S9nAlUM,6684960,6773600,how long it takes to run a function which adds afforda numbers either in the list or in the array,1,1
DyG9S9nAlUM,6987040,7073264,so the real meat the body of the program is this function here some list or,1,1
DyG9S9nAlUM,7590240,7682400,in our array so im just going to add get them together the list version very very similar we set the someone to be 0,1,1
DyG9S9nAlUM,7729440,7800000,so why we havent reached the end of the list and we set p initially to be the first thing in the linked list,2,1
DyG9S9nAlUM,8036160,8122064,so we follow the link to the next thing in the linked list and we keep doing that until we come to the end,1,1
DyG9S9nAlUM,8130880,8204144,there are two programs as simple as you get in terms of implementing a linked list or on array,1,1
DyG9S9nAlUM,8822560,8854560,the list first also going to generate,1,1
DyG9S9nAlUM,8889280,8921280,linked list values to let it run,1,1
DyG9S9nAlUM,9244480,9325904,initializing the link list its allocating all the memory for the different elements and then putting a random number,1,1
DyG9S9nAlUM,10772320,10867184,166 clock ticks over to run the linked list version of the program it takes,1,1
DyG9S9nAlUM,11204800,11328960,each of them up and time how long that takes and well theyll see whether an array actually is faster than the linked list or,1,1
DyG9S9nAlUM,11332480,11368800,whether a linked list will be b array,1,1
DyG9S9nAlUM,11531200,11632800,when we allocate the space for the linked list we have to allocate space for each element and then for the gym there,1,1
DyG9S9nAlUM,12807520,12842384,slower than a linked list i,1,1
DyG9S9nAlUM,14368160,14435664,so going backwards through the array the only thing can we do the same thing with the linked list,1,1
DyG9S9nAlUM,14440960,14478864,well the way weve designed the linked list we,1,1
DyG9S9nAlUM,14599360,14645904,its a singly linked list so we can only move forwards along it,1,1
DyG9S9nAlUM,14646560,14728480,we could design it to be a doubly linked list and have a backwards and forwards pointer,1,1
DyG9S9nAlUM,15916480,15979184,we can pile them up so lets run the linked list test as we did before,1,1
DyG9S9nAlUM,16633600,16712160,when we did the linked list test on the atari it was faster than the array test,1,1
DyG9S9nAlUM,17002720,17071664,faster for the array was on the atari the linked list was faster,1,1
DyG9S9nAlUM,17215840,17324640,thats quicker thats quicker than the original array and thats quicker than the linked list so if we do everything backwards,1,1
DyG9S9nAlUM,18716160,18820160,because the atari was faster to do a linked list in an array and the imac was the other way around,1,1
DyG9S9nAlUM,19364640,19480144,compile it up noticeably slower to compile will do the ll test this is the list version,1,1
DyG9S9nAlUM,19711520,19832304,we now get nine 165 point seven five as an average for the array will run the link list and,1,1
DyG9S9nAlUM,19938560,20032000,point six one for the linked list test and now we run the reverse test,1,1
DyG9S9nAlUM,20404480,20465440,so were running on the atari the linked list was faster than the array,1,1
DyG9S9nAlUM,20471360,20534080,unless he ran the array backwards in which case the array was faster than the linked list and,1,1
DyG9S9nAlUM,20569600,20634384,we ran it on the raspberry pi and here the array was about twice as fast as the linked list,1,0
DyG9S9nAlUM,20639360,20743360,baby rarely backwards the array was slower and if you do it on the imac view range height im faster than the linked list,1,0
DyG9S9nAlUM,22468640,22585104,the data from the array or a linked list and of course the next pointer from the linked list has to come from memory,2,2
DyG9S9nAlUM,24042704,24090048,particularly with the array would also collapse a bit with a linked list we,1,1
DyG9S9nAlUM,24572624,24604624,so the same happens with the route list program,1,1
DyG9S9nAlUM,24612464,24684288,except for one crucial difference with the linked list poem we have to make one memory access,1,1
DyG9S9nAlUM,26002080,26100320,so the array was 46 clock ticks is much faster processor anyway and the link list,1,0
DyG9S9nAlUM,26536320,26584624,irradiation becomes faster than the linked list version,1,1
DyG9S9nAlUM,27567200,27645920,so it runs faster the answer to whether the raise faster than the link list or not,1,1
DyG9S9nAlUM,27996000,28097104,assumptions we make based on what they charity did where the rally was slower than the link list arent true on,1,1

BE5bsyGGLf4,274320,369280,to handle large lists with paging and recyclerview,1,1
BE5bsyGGLf4,369280,428800,now list ui is a very common thing in android applications,1,1
BE5bsyGGLf4,428800,483040,pretty much every single app has a list of something,1,1
BE5bsyGGLf4,549760,613440,lets see how you would model a list like this,1,1
BE5bsyGGLf4,640160,701440,you keep the list of items so that it survives configuration,1,1
BE5bsyGGLf4,1015040,1065280,to return your livedata of list of things,1,1
BE5bsyGGLf4,1065280,1124000,or an observable list of things so that you,1,1
BE5bsyGGLf4,2379200,2420000,give me a livedata of list of users,1,1
BE5bsyGGLf4,3143200,3207040,how do we implement these lists if we dont use paging,1,1
BE5bsyGGLf4,3269760,3336480,you tell it to return a livedata of list of users,1,1
BE5bsyGGLf4,3418160,3473920,in your activity you will use this list activity list,2,2
BE5bsyGGLf4,3592640,3669760,listadapter is a recyclerview adapter that displays a list,1,1
BE5bsyGGLf4,3843520,3878880,method with a different list its,1,1
BE5bsyGGLf4,3918400,3966880,lists on a background thread and update the ui,1,1
BE5bsyGGLf4,4263360,4311520,we send the list to the adapter,1,1
BE5bsyGGLf4,4729440,4785600,obtain the item in the list and do whatever you want with it,1,1
BE5bsyGGLf4,4861440,4899200,what that looks like with a livedata of list,1,1
BE5bsyGGLf4,5101280,5156000,and this is a list that implements the listed or face,1,1
BE5bsyGGLf4,5267360,5376000,as the page list needs it swaps it in and updates the list,2,2
BE5bsyGGLf4,5376000,5411680,so this serves as a replacement for the list,1,1
BE5bsyGGLf4,5494880,5557280,lets swap out the list with a pagedlist,1,1
BE5bsyGGLf4,7398720,7445760,as content is internally updating in those page lists,1,1
BE5bsyGGLf4,7514240,7561120,so if we look at how wed actually implement this list,1,1
BE5bsyGGLf4,9169120,9217600,is the default in the library we will present your lists,1,1
BE5bsyGGLf4,12150400,12215200,we will create a new page list because thats,1,1
BE5bsyGGLf4,12380320,12405600,now to pass this page list over,1,1
BE5bsyGGLf4,12405600,12437440,though we dont want to send an empty list,1,1
BE5bsyGGLf4,14163376,14191360,but because these are two different lists,1,1
BE5bsyGGLf4,14721280,14756320,possible to a livedata of a list because this,1,1
BE5bsyGGLf4,15010240,15071680,lists as they flow in and also the internal updates,1,1
BE5bsyGGLf4,15071680,15097440,of the page list as it loads,1,1
BE5bsyGGLf4,15222560,15284320,so we mentioned that pagedlist is a list implementation that,1,1
BE5bsyGGLf4,16111200,16178560,and we have our data source on the right back by our list,1,1
BE5bsyGGLf4,17217600,17304640,and the page size and get the new data appended to the list,1,1
BE5bsyGGLf4,18161760,18216000,we will calculate the difference between these two lists,1,1
BE5bsyGGLf4,18349600,18427840,so imagine you have some data like a list list of names,2,2
BE5bsyGGLf4,18515520,18573120,by using the first item in the list and the next page,1,1
BE5bsyGGLf4,18573120,18605280,by using the last item in the list,1,1
BE5bsyGGLf4,18848960,18902240,and the item type in the list,1,1
BE5bsyGGLf4,22111360,22185440,its literally like a linked list of pages,1,1
BE5bsyGGLf4,22520960,22550720,i mentioned this is like a linked list,1,1
BE5bsyGGLf4,22550720,22612640,so if the previous list is invalid links in the list,2,2
BE5bsyGGLf4,22825760,22856480,so they are already on top of the list,1,1
BE5bsyGGLf4,27727360,27770720,you can just add this back into your live page list builder,1,1
BE5bsyGGLf4,27770720,27824000,or to your rx page list builder and then that,1,1
BE5bsyGGLf4,28138080,28191680,it extends this live data of list this observable list,2,2
