qJwecTgce6c,142096,212528,in this lesson we’re going to learn about another important geometry quantity called volume,1,1
qJwecTgce6c,212528,285600,specifically we’re going to learn what volume is and what kind of units we use to measure volume,2,2
qJwecTgce6c,285600,352832,and how we can calculate the volumes of a few simple geometric shapes,1,1
qJwecTgce6c,352832,434992,the first thing you need to know is that volume is a quantity that all 3dimensional objects have,1,1
qJwecTgce6c,1409472,1486304,and to measure a 3dimensional object like this we use the 3dimensional quantity called volume,1,1
qJwecTgce6c,1486304,1579664,volume tells us how much 3dimensional space  an object occupies,1,1
qJwecTgce6c,1579664,1627952,alright but how much volume does this cube have,1,1
qJwecTgce6c,1720784,1818944,we say that its volume is exactly one “cubic centimeter”,1,2
qJwecTgce6c,1818944,1899792,so “square units” are used to measure area and “cubic units” are used to measure volume,1,1
qJwecTgce6c,2530672,2605376,see how area and square units are related to volume and cubic units,1,1
qJwecTgce6c,2734752,2824384,well you can use cubic units to measure the volume of any 3d shape not just cubes,1,1
qJwecTgce6c,3004704,3070048,you can use a bunch of small cubes to approximate the volume of the sphere,1,1
qJwecTgce6c,3186672,3280432,and the smaller the cubes you use the closer their combined volume will match the volume of the sphere,2,2
qJwecTgce6c,3280432,3357376,okay so volume is a 3d quantity for measuring 3d objects,1,1
qJwecTgce6c,3397376,3488880,i want to point out that 3d objects also have a type of area that you don’t want to confuse with volume,1,1
qJwecTgce6c,3616656,3749520,well in a similar way 3d objects have both a 3d quantity called volume and a 2d quantity called called “surface area”,1,1
qJwecTgce6c,4064816,4119504,and to help you see the difference between surface area and volume,1,1
qJwecTgce6c,4178992,4243024,if you unfold the box you can see the 2d area that surrounds the volume,1,1
qJwecTgce6c,4243024,4329968,while the volume itself if the amount of 3d space occupied by the ice inside the box,1,1
qJwecTgce6c,4329968,4406032,alright so now that you understand what volume is and you won’t confuse it with surface area,1,1
qJwecTgce6c,4406032,4490192,we’re going to spend the rest of the video learning how to calculate the volumes of some basic geometric shapes,1,1
qJwecTgce6c,5927360,6025920,okay so the good news is that there’s a general formula for calculating the volume of these types of 3d shape,1,1
qJwecTgce6c,6223728,6293120,so let’s start with this rectangular prism and calculate its volume,1,1
qJwecTgce6c,6584384,6678816,now… to find the volume we just need to multiply that area by the length that the base was extended,1,1
qJwecTgce6c,6835936,6913568,so this rectangular prism has a volume of 120 cubic centimeters,1,1
qJwecTgce6c,6913568,6974384,okay let’s try to find the volume of the triangular prism now,1,1
qJwecTgce6c,7498832,7582608,now all we have to do to find the volume is multiply that area by the length that it was extended,1,1
qJwecTgce6c,7691840,7728320,that’s the volume of this prism,1,1
qJwecTgce6c,7728320,7791360,alright are you ready to try finding the volume of the cylinder now,1,1
qJwecTgce6c,8198560,8256720,now that we know the area of the circle to find the volume of the cylinder,1,1
qJwecTgce6c,8464240,8546416,so the volume of this cylinder is 1256 cubic meters,1,1
qJwecTgce6c,8546416,8599232,so do you see how to find the volume of 3d shapes like these,1,1
qJwecTgce6c,8670720,8779040,you just find the area of that shape and then you multiply it by the length that it was extended and that gives you the volume,1,1
qJwecTgce6c,8937920,9047360,“man… now that i know how to accurately calculate volumes playtime is way more fun”,1,1
qJwecTgce6c,9488336,9566768,since the formulas for finding the volumes of spheres and cones are more complicated to explain,1,1
qJwecTgce6c,9694016,9740688,to find the volume of a sphere you use the formula,1,1
qJwecTgce6c,9740688,9812192,volume equals fourthirds times pi times radius cubed,1,1
qJwecTgce6c,9812192,9855408,and to find the volume of a cone you use the formula,1,1
qJwecTgce6c,9855408,9931968,volume equals onethird times height times pi times radius squared,1,1
qJwecTgce6c,10028000,10086160,fortunately that’s the only dimension we need to find its volume,1,1
qJwecTgce6c,10086160,10190464,our formula says that the volume of a sphere is equal to 43 x pi x r3,1,1
qJwecTgce6c,10573808,10653296,which gives us a volume of 3349 centimeters cubed,1,1
qJwecTgce6c,10683168,10746400,to use our formula to find the volume of a cone we need to know two things,1,1
qJwecTgce6c,11537344,11572544,which is the volume of the cone,1,1
qJwecTgce6c,11572544,11618192,alright… so now you know a lot about volume,1,1
qJwecTgce6c,11667264,11716544,and you know that we measure volume with cubic units,1,1
qJwecTgce6c,11716544,11778512,you also learned how to calculate the volume of some basic 3d shapes,1,1

y3TjAHV7esk,4160,207840,let us work this out the first thing we do in order to work on volumes we need write,1,1
y3TjAHV7esk,228640,260640,what is a volume again,1,2
y3TjAHV7esk,260640,350560,volume is the amount of space occupied by a solid so we are looking in here how many,1,0
y3TjAHV7esk,425600,537424,out at the volume of space inside this particular shape equal let us write down that formula,1,1
y3TjAHV7esk,537424,730384,so a volume of a cylinder is pi r squared x height or length so lets,1,1
y3TjAHV7esk,941264,1005744,come up with the final volume,1,1
y3TjAHV7esk,1005744,1194400,so volume v pi x radius i said was 3 and that is going to be 3 squared x the height,1,1
y3TjAHV7esk,1194400,1437280,or the length which is 9m simplify volume equals pi x 9 x 9 9 x 9 is 81,1,2
y3TjAHV7esk,1437280,1579680,volume the complete volume inside that space are this cylinder in total is 81 x pi or 81,2,1

WPyNjbI4_G8,56160,158864,this is a video on volume as always,1,1
WPyNjbI4_G8,680160,775200,have come up on volume so lets start,1,1
WPyNjbI4_G8,775200,912000,volume well ill just draw a quick shape,1,1
WPyNjbI4_G8,1163024,1250400,perfectly flat and volume then is the,1,1
WPyNjbI4_G8,1250400,1440480,a 3d shape takes up so volume is the,1,1

WPyNjbI4_G8,3032480,3102544,is the units of volume and the formula,1,1
WPyNjbI4_G8,3102544,3174544,to move on to some simple volume,1,1
WPyNjbI4_G8,3303664,3414064,question would be whats the volume of,1,1
WPyNjbI4_G8,3414064,3507664,from the formula book that the volume of,1,1
WPyNjbI4_G8,3965584,4027024,work out the volume the volume would,2,2
WPyNjbI4_G8,4146544,4255840,areas centimeter squared volume is,1,1
WPyNjbI4_G8,4909584,5158224,volume you simply do 45 multiplied by 11,1,1
WPyNjbI4_G8,6017760,6114224,centimeters squared so whats the volume,1,2
WPyNjbI4_G8,6074400,6144624,the volume therefore is the,1,1
WPyNjbI4_G8,6547520,6632480,to work out its volume we work out the,1,1
WPyNjbI4_G8,7106720,7206560,volume you multiply that crosssectional,1,1
WPyNjbI4_G8,7462880,7532000,the volume there,1,2
WPyNjbI4_G8,7487680,7585280,okay so weve worked out the volume of,1,1
WPyNjbI4_G8,8112320,8232800,the volume questions in the higher unit,1,1
WPyNjbI4_G8,8352320,8420960,the book you will have the volume of a,1,1
WPyNjbI4_G8,8420960,8503040,perfectly round football and the volume,1,1
WPyNjbI4_G8,8705760,8846880,volume of a cone and is 13 times pi,1,1
WPyNjbI4_G8,9130560,9187200,could work out the volumes of each of,1,1
WPyNjbI4_G8,10121264,10210080,meters cubed the volume of the cone here,1,1
WPyNjbI4_G8,10210080,10272000,for the volume of the cone so ive just,1,1
WPyNjbI4_G8,11229440,11309440,questions that have come up on volume,1,1

i9UUx76DmTE,617760,696480,ready about surface area and volume so,1,1
i9UUx76DmTE,1032480,1125120,area and volume isnt it so surface area,1,2
i9UUx76DmTE,1079520,1175840,and volume ah i have in brought some,1,1
i9UUx76DmTE,2066080,2151520,sections for surface area and volume one,1,1
i9UUx76DmTE,2263824,2356000,area and volume ok lets start,1,1
i9UUx76DmTE,2609920,2730880,if the volume of the small cone is 127 1,1,2
i9UUx76DmTE,2676640,2788960,by 27th of the volume of the given could,1,1
i9UUx76DmTE,7416144,7509280,written volume of the smaller cone this,1,2
i9UUx76DmTE,7457424,7575504,cone is 1 by 27 of the volume of the,1,1
i9UUx76DmTE,7606704,7758544,that volume of smaller is equal to 1 by,1,2
i9UUx76DmTE,7688464,7822384,27 of volume total isnt it volume of,2,2
i9UUx76DmTE,7822384,7881424,this volume total to this denominator,1,1
i9UUx76DmTE,7881424,8007664,down here that i will be getting volume,1,2
i9UUx76DmTE,7938544,8075824,of smaller cone divided by a volume of,1,1
i9UUx76DmTE,8075824,8170864,this employs volume of small one that is,1,1
i9UUx76DmTE,11780464,11865920,thats nice again very simple volume of,1,2
i9UUx76DmTE,11830384,11911520,frustum i am writing down volume of,1,1
i9UUx76DmTE,12614224,12723024,the next volume of rustom is given that,1,1
i9UUx76DmTE,18991360,19130064,now this volume of cylinder volume of,2,3
i9UUx76DmTE,19055680,19178864,cylinder is equal to ten times volume of,1,1
i9UUx76DmTE,19178864,19285600,volume of cylinder is equal to ten ten,1,2
i9UUx76DmTE,19245280,19315360,times volume of cone so now i just need,1,1
i9UUx76DmTE,20037440,20143984,just i will try to find out the volume,1,1
i9UUx76DmTE,20143984,20276944,writing here volume of cylinder volume,2,2
i9UUx76DmTE,20343680,20480944,to 10 times into volume of cone is 1 by,1,1
i9UUx76DmTE,20606704,20706544,only cone ice cream has a volume of,1,1
i9UUx76DmTE,24578400,24686864,cylinder means volume of the cylinder,1,2
i9UUx76DmTE,24633440,24726720,volume of cylinder is and this rises,1,2
i9UUx76DmTE,24686864,24774080,because of this sphere so volume of this,1,2
i9UUx76DmTE,24726720,24827520,cylinder is equal to volume of sphere,1,1
i9UUx76DmTE,24827520,24919680,so now i guess volume of cylinder is,1,2
i9UUx76DmTE,24894240,24967680,equal to volume of sphere you understood,1,1
i9UUx76DmTE,25257600,25387680,write it down volume of cylinder so ill,1,2
i9UUx76DmTE,25327680,25436160,write volume of cylinder that is equal,1,1
i9UUx76DmTE,25723040,25843840,but 32 by nine is equal to volume of,1,2
i9UUx76DmTE,25768624,25906864,sphere okay volume of sphere is 2 by 3,1,1
i9UUx76DmTE,33814880,33961280,volume of the cylinder so total surface,1,1

pOGVngLsaX4,294720,382400,going to focus on volumes doctor volumes,2,2
pOGVngLsaX4,1556640,1699664,volumes from so lets focus on this one,1,2
pOGVngLsaX4,1618544,1758720,first so the  fee or   volume its a,1,2
pOGVngLsaX4,1699664,1804784,bind mount of a volume so youre buying,1,1
pOGVngLsaX4,3049600,3115360,thats the volume flag that what i was,1,1
pOGVngLsaX4,9712800,9807360,demonstrate is creating volume so these,1,1
pOGVngLsaX4,10234560,10334880,v and were going to create a volume,1,2
pOGVngLsaX4,10296320,10378080,docker volume so were not doing a bind,1,2
pOGVngLsaX4,10932960,11008320,were just creating involve a volume a,1,2
pOGVngLsaX4,10960320,11042400,dock a volume called data explain what,1,1
pOGVngLsaX4,11701440,11827200,containers that share this data volume,1,1
pOGVngLsaX4,11889600,12010560,that ill show is docker volume ls so it,1,2
pOGVngLsaX4,11974560,12047520,actually created a docker volume called,1,1
pOGVngLsaX4,12245280,12321120,weve created a docker volume and weve,1,1
pOGVngLsaX4,12351840,12460800,docker volume such as if i did the,1,2
pOGVngLsaX4,12388800,12505920,docket volume   help we can see that,1,2
pOGVngLsaX4,12460800,12543840,we can create a volume we can inspect we,1,2
pOGVngLsaX4,12505920,12593280,can list and we can remove volumes now,1,1
pOGVngLsaX4,12672000,12744480,storage so the container from the volume,1,2
pOGVngLsaX4,12706560,12753424,we can share this volume amongst,1,1
pOGVngLsaX4,12895520,12954064,volume to this container put some bits,1,1
pOGVngLsaX4,12991520,13077920,going to delete the volume create a new,1,1
pOGVngLsaX4,13026064,13142224,container and attach this volume to the,1,1
pOGVngLsaX4,13502560,13656304,directory this is the volume and also,1,1
pOGVngLsaX4,14021104,14107984,docker volume is still intact docker,1,2
pOGVngLsaX4,14071984,14179984,volume ls we can see that we still have,1,1
pOGVngLsaX4,14251984,14345600,data volume and still use the the files,1,1
pOGVngLsaX4,14961600,15069120,name of test3 the volume that we are,1,2
pOGVngLsaX4,15028320,15114720,using is the data volume now because the,1,2
pOGVngLsaX4,15069120,15145920,data volume exists we obviously dont,1,1
pOGVngLsaX4,15145920,15264000,attach that existing volume were going,1,1
pOGVngLsaX4,15635040,15709920,decoupled from the from the volumes and,1,1
pOGVngLsaX4,15731040,15804960,attached the volumes that weve attached,1,1
pOGVngLsaX4,15804960,15912960,attach that volume to the new container,1,1
pOGVngLsaX4,16113120,16281120,volume ls lets remove this volume our,2,3
pOGVngLsaX4,16187520,16315680,docket volume our m of data now im,1,2
pOGVngLsaX4,16281120,16369920,going to show you another volume command,1,1
pOGVngLsaX4,16369920,16448160,help were going to do this volumes from,1,1
pOGVngLsaX4,16448160,16608944,so this volumes from command will allow,1,2
pOGVngLsaX4,16535520,16662720,us to mount the volumes from a specified,1,1
pOGVngLsaX4,17218080,17352960,have no containers here docker volumes,1,2
pOGVngLsaX4,17276960,17425440,or volume minus ls or ls we have no,1,2
pOGVngLsaX4,17352960,17467680,volumes so lets do a docker run  i t,1,1
pOGVngLsaX4,17545920,17662080,were going to create a volume called,1,1
pOGVngLsaX4,17771520,17911040,another volume were going to do  v,1,1
pOGVngLsaX4,18158400,18247680,master weve got two volumes that were,1,1
pOGVngLsaX4,18279840,18361920,backup and slash logs these volumes they,1,1
pOGVngLsaX4,18398880,18483360,be created as docker volumes and were,1,1
pOGVngLsaX4,19429920,19506704,clear the screen to a docket volume,1,2
pOGVngLsaX4,19466864,19549920,again just to list these volumes so,1,2
pOGVngLsaX4,19506704,19604624,weve created these volumes as we,1,1
pOGVngLsaX4,19604624,19679360,container lets use the volumes from,1,1
pOGVngLsaX4,19679360,19814864,mount all of these volumes in one so by,1,1
pOGVngLsaX4,19977120,20099040,volumes  from were going to give the,1,1
pOGVngLsaX4,20140304,20273760,volumes from so this is master and again,1,1
pOGVngLsaX4,20374384,20489120,volumes  from we give the master,1,1
pOGVngLsaX4,20531040,20627520,mount all the volumes from this master,1,1
pOGVngLsaX4,21740800,21810400,do a volume because there is another,1,1
pOGVngLsaX4,21849760,21981760,the volume lets do a curve volume ls,2,2
pOGVngLsaX4,21981760,22095520,its docker volume,1,2
pOGVngLsaX4,22095520,22204000,just going to do the backup volume for,1,1
pOGVngLsaX4,22250880,22345600,information about the the docker volume,1,1
pOGVngLsaX4,22433920,22492800,different volumes if theyre if you have,1,1
pOGVngLsaX4,22492800,22573120,volumes and so forth so you can have,1,1
pOGVngLsaX4,23576160,23694240,volumes and mount points or by mounting,1,1

qHuDN-I9apg,20640,129584,about the flow volume loops the flow,1,2
qHuDN-I9apg,69104,193920,volume loop basically plots the airflow,1,1
qHuDN-I9apg,193920,316320,inspiration against the lung volume on,1,1
qHuDN-I9apg,757440,861120,volume loop this isnt the case the,1,1
qHuDN-I9apg,1156320,1286240,volume loops are kind of very easy so,1,1
qHuDN-I9apg,1411680,1471680,from your residual volume to your total,1,1
qHuDN-I9apg,1656480,1745760,volume so this is what a normal flow,1,2
qHuDN-I9apg,1712160,1797120,volume loop looks like its pretty,1,1
qHuDN-I9apg,2136960,2208480,and your residual volume will increase,1,1
qHuDN-I9apg,2208480,2288640,increase in the tlc and residual volume,1,1
qHuDN-I9apg,2374560,2537760,so the flow volume loop would look like,1,1
qHuDN-I9apg,3288960,3434400,the residual volume decreases and the,1,1
qHuDN-I9apg,3466064,3565440,smaller version of normal low volume,1,1
qHuDN-I9apg,3667680,3798560,version of the you know low volume loop,1,1
qHuDN-I9apg,3848640,3934560,lung disease the flow volume blue shifts,1,1
qHuDN-I9apg,4047344,4155824,mnemonic flow volume loop if the loop,1,1
qHuDN-I9apg,4184160,4258560,flow volume blue shifts towards the left,1,1
qHuDN-I9apg,6050400,6158400,this will look like on the flow volume,1,1
qHuDN-I9apg,6250560,6361440,part of the low volume loop so this is,1,1
qHuDN-I9apg,7672480,7781280,on the flow volume loop is um there,1,1
qHuDN-I9apg,7852960,7947040,the flow volume loop so this will,1,1
qHuDN-I9apg,8233920,8366384,your flow volume loop looks like this,1,1

hC6zx9WAiC4,1157600,1204960,interesting because its close to the formula for the volume,1,1
hC6zx9WAiC4,1671360,1735360,that would give you the volume of an entire cylinder that,1,1
hC6zx9WAiC4,1765440,1826112,so this would give you this entire volume,1,1
hC6zx9WAiC4,1971360,2007360,h or h times pi r squared its the volume,1,1
hC6zx9WAiC4,2208000,2265760,is 13 the volume of this cylinder that is essentially,1,1
hC6zx9WAiC4,2513280,2567520,for me the volume of a cylinder is very intuitive,1,1
hC6zx9WAiC4,2659360,2703360,and so the volume of a cone is just 13 of that,1,1
hC6zx9WAiC4,2703360,2761360,its just 13 the volume of the bounding cylinder,1,1

aFAk8JA4-d8,211200,304320,volume so like between cubic feet and,1,1
aFAk8JA4-d8,3033120,3146880,lets look at units of volume what is,1,1

lg4ObZR5Pyo,90240,186224,talking about volume trading and volume,2,3
lg4ObZR5Pyo,123360,215040,and practicing how to trade volume to,1,2
lg4ObZR5Pyo,186224,236944,start off with what is volume for those,1,1
lg4ObZR5Pyo,236944,297120,so volume represents the number of,1,1
lg4ObZR5Pyo,438240,516464,right below that if you have volume,1,1
lg4ObZR5Pyo,867360,967184,start off with what how good volume is,1,2
lg4ObZR5Pyo,917264,1035360,volume has many pros and really not too,1,1
lg4ObZR5Pyo,1035360,1095360,things about about volume or you said is,1,1
lg4ObZR5Pyo,1354544,1439520,whereas volume is going to be using info,1,1
lg4ObZR5Pyo,1970880,2043840,types of volume spikes that i have,1,1
lg4ObZR5Pyo,2176320,2238720,common volume is bike that youve,1,1
lg4ObZR5Pyo,3243200,3331200,identifying these types of volume spikes,1,1
lg4ObZR5Pyo,3331200,3388800,is strong continuation volume and i said,1,1
lg4ObZR5Pyo,3468480,3533760,also known as basing volume because its,1,1
lg4ObZR5Pyo,3501600,3562560,the volume at the base of a trend and,1,1
lg4ObZR5Pyo,3666720,3728640,volume spike that indicates oversold and,1,1
lg4ObZR5Pyo,3809760,3880800,very strong volume in the direction,1,1
lg4ObZR5Pyo,4161440,4239040,volume in the direction of that reversal,1,1
lg4ObZR5Pyo,4286560,4327840,volume spike that indicates that a,1,1
lg4ObZR5Pyo,4504000,4563520,high volume you need to see a volume,2,2
lg4ObZR5Pyo,4947520,5027680,volume is this and if i told you that,1,1
lg4ObZR5Pyo,5092000,5184160,volume is this as well right here,1,1
lg4ObZR5Pyo,5245120,5338240,reason i say this is oversold volume is,1,2
lg4ObZR5Pyo,5270080,5350720,a few reasons a volume spike which means,1,1
lg4ObZR5Pyo,5350720,5405920,these three because volume is clearly,1,1
lg4ObZR5Pyo,6699680,6758720,is overbought volume right here you see,1,1
lg4ObZR5Pyo,7171040,7248800,question is this what type of volume is,1,1
lg4ObZR5Pyo,7528160,7589600,after a volume spike that breaks above,1,1
lg4ObZR5Pyo,7678704,7751840,very strong volume as well and we were,1,1
lg4ObZR5Pyo,8168000,8240000,you can see here we have a volume spike,1,1
lg4ObZR5Pyo,8198240,8269760,this is very clear breakout volume right,1,1
lg4ObZR5Pyo,8240000,8304320,here strong momentum strong volume above,1,1
lg4ObZR5Pyo,8730240,8824800,types of volume again and this guy so,1,1
lg4ObZR5Pyo,8824800,8916000,volume is this and would you buy or sell,1,1
lg4ObZR5Pyo,8916000,8991344,this is very clear breakout volume this,1,1
lg4ObZR5Pyo,9182880,9271200,support on very high volume i mean this,1,1
lg4ObZR5Pyo,9793920,9860640,such high volume the reason correctly,1,1
lg4ObZR5Pyo,10138080,10212000,three types of volume is this and do you,1,1
lg4ObZR5Pyo,10308464,10377600,downtrend volume spike here that,1,1
lg4ObZR5Pyo,10575344,10618080,continuation volume and again what i had,1,1
lg4ObZR5Pyo,10759184,10834080,volume not yet because price is not,1,1
lg4ObZR5Pyo,10834080,10903040,is clearly not overbought volume it,1,1
lg4ObZR5Pyo,11276144,11337600,breakout volume youre kind of right but,1,1
lg4ObZR5Pyo,11396144,11467184,get another volume spike the propels,1,1
lg4ObZR5Pyo,11467184,11556960,continuation volume now one little,1,1
lg4ObZR5Pyo,11654384,11721600,can do is actually look at volume and,1,1
lg4ObZR5Pyo,11830560,11908800,significant volume spike just a minor,1,2
lg4ObZR5Pyo,11864640,11928464,volume spike and what i mean by that is,1,1
lg4ObZR5Pyo,11928464,11997104,moving average this volume spike looks,1,1
lg4ObZR5Pyo,12036960,12121424,to have much higher volume than that so,1,1
lg4ObZR5Pyo,12207840,12275024,look at volume to distinguish why we,1,1
lg4ObZR5Pyo,12275024,12338384,dont really see significant volume at,1,1
lg4ObZR5Pyo,12338384,12421920,volume here yes we see about i would say,1,1
lg4ObZR5Pyo,12421920,12501104,here of a volume spike here had a price,1,1
lg4ObZR5Pyo,12652304,12739680,trading volume and this one is a little,1,1
lg4ObZR5Pyo,12758880,12831360,market so this is called trending volume,1,1
lg4ObZR5Pyo,13050720,13119840,volume trending right here and what i,1,1
lg4ObZR5Pyo,13096320,13151040,mean by that is dont look at volume,1,2
lg4ObZR5Pyo,13119840,13176000,spikes dont look at specific volume,1,1
lg4ObZR5Pyo,13176000,13243680,of the overall volume and then compare,1,1
lg4ObZR5Pyo,13433280,13502384,we have a volume that is increasing you,1,1
lg4ObZR5Pyo,13474080,13527200,can pretty clearly see that volume is,1,1
lg4ObZR5Pyo,13527200,13607840,and then we have a volume spike,1,1
lg4ObZR5Pyo,13607840,13683344,but notice that the lack of volume is,1,1
lg4ObZR5Pyo,13807200,13857120,its volume increasing during the,1,2
lg4ObZR5Pyo,13824000,13880640,uptrend and why is volume decreasing,1,1
lg4ObZR5Pyo,13906560,13991520,how can i use this volumes increasing,1,1
lg4ObZR5Pyo,14646720,14724000,at the volume that volume was increasing,2,2
lg4ObZR5Pyo,14724000,14812800,downtrend and theres a volume spike,1,1
lg4ObZR5Pyo,14902064,14974864,volume patterns when you look at the,1,1
lg4ObZR5Pyo,14974864,15092144,kind of the shrinking volume that occurs,1,1
lg4ObZR5Pyo,15245744,15347984,analyzing some volume so im just gonna,1,1
lg4ObZR5Pyo,15517424,15567824,volume right here and you probably would,1,1
lg4ObZR5Pyo,15858224,15914384,significant volume spike thats much,1,1
lg4ObZR5Pyo,15914384,15999344,volume moving average of 10 as you can,1,1
lg4ObZR5Pyo,16127984,16249904,sold and yeah we see oversold volume,1,1
lg4ObZR5Pyo,16341104,16414544,break out volume as you can see here,1,1
lg4ObZR5Pyo,16414544,16495680,level on a very high volume which,1,1
lg4ObZR5Pyo,16551840,16632000,continuation volume thats not,1,1
lg4ObZR5Pyo,16632000,16699184,some good continuation volume here let,1,1
lg4ObZR5Pyo,16699184,16755344,good examples of continuation volume,1,2
lg4ObZR5Pyo,16721760,16784624,here not really significant volume,1,1
lg4ObZR5Pyo,16815360,16874864,volume here with that candlestick then,1,2
lg4ObZR5Pyo,16847520,16904144,these cal sticks have significant volume,1,1
lg4ObZR5Pyo,16989600,17044640,continuation volume as well because,1,1
lg4ObZR5Pyo,17110880,17279840,volume that occurred with a bit of an,1,1
lg4ObZR5Pyo,17391200,17490080,here look at volume what is volume doing,2,2
lg4ObZR5Pyo,17490080,17594720,nothing volume is like flat and even,1,1
lg4ObZR5Pyo,17594720,17662400,volume volume divergence and i think i,2,2
lg4ObZR5Pyo,17744960,17847200,volume and as price is very slowly going,1,1
lg4ObZR5Pyo,17847200,17922560,volume spike at a resistance level and,1,1
lg4ObZR5Pyo,18014240,18134240,how to trade volume we went over using,1,3
lg4ObZR5Pyo,18080320,18184640,volume spikes we went over volume spikes,2,3
lg4ObZR5Pyo,18134240,18203360,we went over volume trends and what,1,1
lg4ObZR5Pyo,18302720,18366080,you have any questions about volume,1,1

wdr2Kx6tdd8,492464,594560,bam mr tarrou in this lesson we are going to learn another technique for finding volumes,1,1
wdr2Kx6tdd8,681120,743360,of the video what we are going to be doing is comparing how to find these volumes that,1,1
wdr2Kx6tdd8,895040,1005120,the volume between these two methods we do that because you have a choice as to which,1,1
wdr2Kx6tdd8,1159840,1209760,words it’s going to be easier to find the volume of that solid depending on whether,1,1
wdr2Kx6tdd8,1346560,1448160,we have already talked about how to find volumes using the disk method now one thing to pay,1,1
wdr2Kx6tdd8,1448160,1513120,attention to now that we are going to start the comparison is when you are finding volumes,1,1
wdr2Kx6tdd8,1600000,1725120,creates these disks that we use to estimate the volumes is those representative rectangles,1,1
wdr2Kx6tdd8,2082384,2201456,the volume now if we have that same horizontal axis of rotation you can see with the shell,1,1
wdr2Kx6tdd8,2498880,2570064,zero we are going to be finding basically again be finding the volume of a cylinder,1,1
wdr2Kx6tdd8,2652960,2755344,so it’s a shell and really how to find the volume of a shell at least a cylindrical,1,1
wdr2Kx6tdd8,2755344,2822240,shell is to find the volume of the outside cylinder find the volume of the inside cylinder,2,2
wdr2Kx6tdd8,3311680,3413440,to approach infinity and giving us a basically exact approximation again of the volume of,1,1
wdr2Kx6tdd8,3559520,3636640,we are going to have the volume of a shell now i have taken this whatever the blue,1,1
wdr2Kx6tdd8,3731344,3840960,the volume of a cylinder is pi times the radius squared times the height but we are going,1,1
wdr2Kx6tdd8,3909280,3999824,the volume of the inside cylinder giving us the shell and we have the height which is,1,1
wdr2Kx6tdd8,4816000,4952480,when i give us our formal formulas but when we look at all of this we have the volume,1,1
wdr2Kx6tdd8,5624320,5752144,left with is two of these terms giving me a simplified version of the volume of a shell,1,1
wdr2Kx6tdd8,6148624,6245280,screen if you have a horizontal axis of rotation then using finding the volume using the shell,1,1
wdr2Kx6tdd8,6575664,6655840,integrate with respect to y so the volume is equal to 2pi times the definite integral,1,1
wdr2Kx6tdd8,6945584,7044320,the volume of a cylinder was pi r2 the area of the base times the height but when you,1,1
wdr2Kx6tdd8,7752800,7857440,a circle its 2 pi r times h so yes we are talking about volumes but with those delta,1,1
wdr2Kx6tdd8,10166720,10249440,1 find the volume of the solid formed by revolving the region that one about the,1,1
wdr2Kx6tdd8,10770240,10913104,this up so our volume is going to be equal to let’s see that formula again 2 pi times,1,1
wdr2Kx6tdd8,14445600,14573120,volume has an area excuse me our volume has a value of 27 pi over 2 cubic units and,2,2
wdr2Kx6tdd8,15173280,15263040,though so that means that if i am going to go through the process of finding the volume,1,1
wdr2Kx6tdd8,15263040,15328640,using the disk method which by the way the volume using the disk method is going to be,1,1
wdr2Kx6tdd8,17597120,17680800,my lower limit now is going to be 1 and upper limit is going to be 4 so my volume is going,1,1
wdr2Kx6tdd8,18771360,18833440,i am going to pull a clip from an old video where i taught how to find the volume of these,1,1
wdr2Kx6tdd8,20616160,20692000,hole in iti need to find the volume of the larger disk and then subtract out the volume,2,1
wdr2Kx6tdd8,23129920,23211200,finding the integral i did the definite integral and came up with the volume of this solid,1,1
wdr2Kx6tdd8,23454400,23522416,finding the volume of the solid let’s see what it looks like doing it with the shell,1,1
wdr2Kx6tdd8,27270096,27463680,what you believe is best and easiest it’s the last example find the volume of the solid,1,1
wdr2Kx6tdd8,28100000,28167840,section of finding volumes using disk and washer method that we have a portion of this,1,1
wdr2Kx6tdd8,28827200,28946560,going to have a definite integral to represent this volume that looks pretty much something,1,1
wdr2Kx6tdd8,31784160,31883680,okay so as we set up our definite integral to find the volume of this solid using the,1,1
wdr2Kx6tdd8,31883680,32074560,shell method well that is going to be the volume is equal to 2 pi times the definite,1,1
wdr2Kx6tdd8,33908160,33983040,now that we have the definite integral set up for finding volume using the shell method,1,1
wdr2Kx6tdd8,34405920,34485600,for the solid the volume of this solid which i am pointing to like i drew the three,1,1
wdr2Kx6tdd8,34485600,34566080,dimensional solid or attempted tobut the volume comes out to be 16 pi over 3 cubic,1,1

rC2ibuCRfzo,48000,104320,in this video we get to take a look at what volume is,1,1
rC2ibuCRfzo,319360,431360,so lets take a closer look at that definition and how we measure such things as volume and you may notice if you look around wherever you happen to be that just about everything youre looking at has three dimensions,1,0
rC2ibuCRfzo,2894720,2948480,so therefore we say that the volume is 40 cubic cm,1,1
rC2ibuCRfzo,3184960,3296960,so for any regular space where you can take the measurement of each dimension you can use those measurements to figure out the volume,1,1
rC2ibuCRfzo,4344640,4456640,well that would give us 70 cubic cm so in doing this what we can do is create markings simply by how high the water is to mark the volume for that height of water or whatever you happen to be filling it with,1,1
rC2ibuCRfzo,4552640,4611840,and they tell you the volume of a liquid filled to that mark,1,1

f6nUNTfiK5Y,177120,261760,times height gives you the volume of a square pyramid,1,1
f6nUNTfiK5Y,309440,386880,first well create a pyramid with a square base and fill in its volume,1,1
f6nUNTfiK5Y,702384,795360,and if the step pyramid has an infinite amount of slices then the volume of the step pyramid,1,1
f6nUNTfiK5Y,795360,875040,is equal to the volume of the square pyramid,1,1
f6nUNTfiK5Y,875040,951184,so lets derive a formula for the volume of a step pyramid with an arbitrary amount of,1,1
f6nUNTfiK5Y,1227360,1309440,so lets take a look at one of the prisms and remember that its volume is equal to length,1,1
f6nUNTfiK5Y,1478240,1577760,therefore volume is equal to length x length x height,1,1
f6nUNTfiK5Y,1577760,1654080,so now we have a general formula for volume of a rectangular prism,1,1
f6nUNTfiK5Y,3312480,3424480,and now the volume of a rectangular prism becomes equal to  ln x ln,1,1
f6nUNTfiK5Y,3624000,3696640,so in order to find the volume of the step pyramid we simply calculate the volume,2,2
f6nUNTfiK5Y,3776640,3881920,so lining up the prisms we start from the beginning and we have volume of the step pyramid,1,1
f6nUNTfiK5Y,4139184,4227040,and we continue this process up until the last prism which has a volume of,1,1
f6nUNTfiK5Y,4601440,4713440,therefore the volume of the step pyramid is equal to ln squared x hn x the sum of integers,1,1
f6nUNTfiK5Y,6167520,6279520,and now we have volume of the step pyramid is equal to l2h over 6 times 2 3n  1n2,1,1
f6nUNTfiK5Y,6452000,6550224,to infinitely many slices therefore the volume of the step pyramid becomes equal to the volume,2,2
f6nUNTfiK5Y,7524480,7633600,and finally we have 13 area of the base x heigth which gives us the volume of a square,1,1

AB9zpbc8fUE,0,71520,welcome to a lesson on volume volume is a three dimensional measurement that,2,1
AB9zpbc8fUE,152160,240960,the volume we count the number of unit cubes inside a shape if there are units,1,1
AB9zpbc8fUE,408320,504320,so remember with area we count unit squares and with volume we count unit cubes,1,1
AB9zpbc8fUE,624320,675840,for a were asked to find the volume of the cube shown,1,1
AB9zpbc8fUE,701760,801120,we know all the edges have a length of four inches to determine the volume we,1,1
AB9zpbc8fUE,801120,880320,need to determine how many cubic inches will fit inside this cube the volume,1,1
AB9zpbc8fUE,880320,959360,formula for a cube is v equals scubed where v is the volume,1,1
AB9zpbc8fUE,1016624,1108320,this is the same formula as the volume for a rectangular solid v equals l times w,1,1
AB9zpbc8fUE,1212000,1348320,lengths are the same so using the volume formula v equals scubed s is equal to four,1,1
AB9zpbc8fUE,1348320,1495664,inches and therefore the volume v equals the cube of four which is equal to four,1,1
AB9zpbc8fUE,1740480,1841280,now lets verify that the volume is sixtyfour cubic inches by cutting this cube into,1,1
AB9zpbc8fUE,2047680,2117760,now that we have the cube cut into cubic inches we can verify that the volume is,1,1
AB9zpbc8fUE,2226880,2350720,four layers of sixteen cubic inches giving us a total volume of sixtyfour cubic inches for b,1,1
AB9zpbc8fUE,2350720,2416320,were asked to find the volume of the box with sides of length two feet three feet,1,1
AB9zpbc8fUE,2579840,2652800,the volume is equal to the number of cubic feet that will fit inside this box,1,1
AB9zpbc8fUE,2652800,2763840,to determine the volume we can use the volume formula v equals l times w times h,2,2
AB9zpbc8fUE,2763840,2837440,so the volume is equal to the length times the width times the height which,1,1
AB9zpbc8fUE,2837440,2960000,in this case wed have the volume v is equal to two feet times three feet times five feet two times three,1,1
AB9zpbc8fUE,2960000,3081920,times five is equal to thirty and therefore the volume is thirty cubic feet,1,1
AB9zpbc8fUE,3081920,3205440,again for this example lets divide the box into cubic feet to verify the volume is thirty cubic feet,1,1
AB9zpbc8fUE,3533760,3625920,which does give us a total of thirty cubic feet verifying the volume is correct,1,1

mNadr6bGEMU,7536160,7652320,out from this normal tidal volume,1,1
mNadr6bGEMU,7869760,7931680,im taking from my normal tidal volume,1,1
mNadr6bGEMU,7931680,7992640,i possibly can be on that title volume,1,1
mNadr6bGEMU,8257120,8319840,what is this total volume of air that,1,1
mNadr6bGEMU,8319840,8433120,beyond my tidal volume expiration this,1,2
mNadr6bGEMU,8371360,8476960,is called my expiratory reserve volume,1,1
mNadr6bGEMU,8508160,8663040,reserve volume is in a male usually,1,1
mNadr6bGEMU,8663040,8742880,we have our inspiratory reserve volume,1,1
mNadr6bGEMU,8708640,8777920,we have our expiratory reserve volume,1,1
mNadr6bGEMU,8777920,8849920,volume our normal tidal volume is going,2,2
mNadr6bGEMU,8943040,9000160,tidal volume is the amount of air thats,1,1
mNadr6bGEMU,8965600,9027040,going in and out so the title volume,1,1
mNadr6bGEMU,9080800,9171840,so technically tidal volume as a whole,1,1

mNadr6bGEMU,11119360,11190880,how do we find that if the total volume,1,1
mNadr6bGEMU,11249920,11302240,the tidal volume inhalation so think,1,1
mNadr6bGEMU,11343040,11408800,volume inspiration okay,1,1
mNadr6bGEMU,11408800,11479360,line my expiratory reserve volume is the,1,2
mNadr6bGEMU,11479360,11558080,exhaling beyond my tidal volume,1,1
mNadr6bGEMU,11708800,11788000,beyond tidal volume exhalation is called,1,2
mNadr6bGEMU,11750560,11826880,my expiratory reserve volume thats on,1,1
mNadr6bGEMU,11873920,11950240,certain volume of air in my lungs that,1,1
mNadr6bGEMU,11982080,12045920,and thats called residual volume now,1,1
mNadr6bGEMU,12127520,12168800,got all that title volumes normally five,1,1
mNadr6bGEMU,12886384,12944464,down to zero thats the residual volume,1,1
mNadr6bGEMU,13498880,13582224,as the total volume of air that you can,1,1
mNadr6bGEMU,13582224,13639520,bringing in air my tidal volume,1,1
mNadr6bGEMU,13700000,13781600,volume which is this point to this point,1,1
mNadr6bGEMU,13827680,13951520,its just tidal volume plus ir v well if,1,2
mNadr6bGEMU,13880000,13993264,its just tidal volume plus my ir v and,1,1
mNadr6bGEMU,13993264,14062384,could say tidal volume inspiration if,1,1
mNadr6bGEMU,14122560,14265104,this is title volume is 500 ml plus the,1,1
mNadr6bGEMU,14811840,14884800,tidal volume exhalation is this point,1,1
mNadr6bGEMU,14884800,14942384,that title volume expiration all the way,1,1
mNadr6bGEMU,15006224,15070064,volume expiration so if thats the case,1,1
mNadr6bGEMU,15070064,15197264,tidal volume expiration and im adding,1,1
mNadr6bGEMU,15197264,15238560,particular its the tidal volume,1,2
mNadr6bGEMU,15210224,15282224,expiration we said tidal volume is,1,1
mNadr6bGEMU,16096304,16160640,is my expiratory reserve volume which is,1,1
mNadr6bGEMU,16239360,16295040,i have to have a certain volume of air,1,1
mNadr6bGEMU,16985760,17070240,defined as the total volume of air that,1,1
mNadr6bGEMU,17070240,17132160,volume of air that can exhale forcefully,1,1
mNadr6bGEMU,17132160,17186400,have to account for my tidal volume no,1,1
mNadr6bGEMU,17186400,17248320,have my type of volume here in this,1,1
mNadr6bGEMU,17406720,17464320,volume inspiration then i have to,1,1
mNadr6bGEMU,17506080,17616944,have to add my erv plus my tidal volume,1,1
mNadr6bGEMU,18011520,18079200,tidal volume and again some people will,1,1
mNadr6bGEMU,18079200,18124800,title volume inspiration exploration no,1,1
mNadr6bGEMU,18175200,18305280,title volume here and we just say title,1,2
mNadr6bGEMU,18207360,18336000,volume plus erv plus ir v so tidal,1,2
mNadr6bGEMU,18305280,18358560,volumes about 500 mls,1,1
mNadr6bGEMU,18793280,18906240,so 4600 milliliters is the total volume,1,1
mNadr6bGEMU,19091520,19143840,capacity is the total volume of air that,1,1
mNadr6bGEMU,19143840,19205760,accounting for the residual volume the,1,1
mNadr6bGEMU,19568640,19744320,so it goes like this right tidal volume,1,1
mNadr6bGEMU,19744320,19806720,because i told you its the total volume,1,1
mNadr6bGEMU,19829760,19896960,residual volume so it goes from 0 to the,1,1
mNadr6bGEMU,20186720,20241440,understand what these volumes how you,1,1

P79EC9qHXEg,4160,218720,hi guys we are doing volumes and we have a very vast volume here in a very different,2,2
P79EC9qHXEg,260944,363520,but first of all let’s go through the definition of a volume a volume is the amount of space,2,2
P79EC9qHXEg,644480,700320,rare but you do see them now what’s the point here with volumes,1,1
P79EC9qHXEg,927344,1017424,2 is multiplied by the depth and then we get the volume and of course all units here shown,1,1
P79EC9qHXEg,2107200,2178224,now we are going to get the depth so we can find how much capacity of volumes it has within,1,1
P79EC9qHXEg,2285280,2440160,so let’s write this up – so volume equals the area times the depth over here so it called,1,1
P79EC9qHXEg,2696464,2863504,up – we have 35 times the depth of 8 centimeters – so the volumes of these total area here,1,1

ZwMUpPOAOSE,0,85120,welcome to a lesson on how to determine the volume of a right circular cylinder,1,1
ZwMUpPOAOSE,85120,158400,and the volume of a square pyramid volume of a solid is equal to the,2,2
ZwMUpPOAOSE,258064,315840,notice how the lengths are given in centimeters and therefore the volume is,1,1
ZwMUpPOAOSE,420304,491840,the volume of a right circular cylinder we use the formula v equals pi times r,1,1
ZwMUpPOAOSE,491840,589440,squared times h where v is the volume r is the radius and h is the height,1,1
ZwMUpPOAOSE,725744,855984,and therefore the volume v is equal to pi times six squared times twelve,1,1
ZwMUpPOAOSE,856000,930240,well determine the exact volume in terms of pi and also get a decimal,1,1
ZwMUpPOAOSE,987184,1110080,so the volume v is equal to pi times six squared is thirtysix thirtysix times twelve is equal to,1,1
ZwMUpPOAOSE,1110080,1225600,four hundred thirtytwo and therefore the exact volume is four hundred thirtytwo pi and the units are cubic,1,1
ZwMUpPOAOSE,1321264,1417584,volume often we use three point one four as an approximation for pi,1,1
ZwMUpPOAOSE,2584320,2682560,cylinder and now lets determine the volume of the square pyramid were given the volume,2,2
ZwMUpPOAOSE,2764800,2824960,this formula can be used to determine the volume of a pyramid,1,1
ZwMUpPOAOSE,3063680,3106240,the volume is equal to the number of cubic meters,1,1
ZwMUpPOAOSE,3106240,3213760,that will fit inside the pyramid using the formula we have the volume v equals,1,1
ZwMUpPOAOSE,3353440,3482240,volume v is equal to onethird times six is two two times six is twelve twelve times twelve is one hundred fortyfour,1,1
ZwMUpPOAOSE,3482240,3580480,the volume is exactly one hundred fortyfour and the units are cubic meters,1,1
HWzY_js5ljU,76320,151200,search volume is over 250 what do you think i should do doc should i go for it,1,1
HWzY_js5ljU,934560,996944,lot of people have said ive done it with different search volumes with,1,1
HWzY_js5ljU,996944,1056960,higher search volumes and it worked fine and then a whole other set of people say,1,1
HWzY_js5ljU,1267200,1338240,ill give you a couple of scenarios ill tell you why the search volume matters,1,1
HWzY_js5ljU,1422240,1491360,search volume over 250 and ill tell you if you should think twice about going,1,1
HWzY_js5ljU,1491360,1548960,after a search volume over 250 or not and with that ill give you a little,1,1
HWzY_js5ljU,2090864,2142240,them so heres why the search volume matters now ive,1,1
HWzY_js5ljU,2281440,2350080,higher search volume takes longer to rank for theres a couple things in play,1,1
HWzY_js5ljU,2350080,2419200,here right so a higher search volume usually means its more profitable so if,1,1
HWzY_js5ljU,2564160,2643824,5000 you could expect did that search volume that keyword phrase is going to,1,1
HWzY_js5ljU,2860800,2922720,the volume matters now the other part and this is the part that is untested,1,1
HWzY_js5ljU,3479040,3550080,theres higher search volumes like i said 5000 to say 10000 it may take you,1,1
HWzY_js5ljU,3774720,3836640,approach its probably going to take you longer to rank for those higher volume,1,1
HWzY_js5ljU,3836640,3908160,search terms so this way the search volume matters number one if its a,1,1
HWzY_js5ljU,3908160,3970080,higher search volume term its more profitable and basically more people are,1,1
HWzY_js5ljU,4044960,4127040,well number two it seems like the google sandbox takes longer for higher volume,1,1
HWzY_js5ljU,4920640,4996000,progressive scale so if you have a very high search volume its gonna take,1,1
HWzY_js5ljU,5424640,5495680,volume terms now my previous answer on who should go for it it still applies,1,1
HWzY_js5ljU,6460320,6515520,after the higher volume search terms and youll be able to rank a little bit more,1,1
sJ5vhShdVjo,9920,86560,in this video well be building a stylish desktop volume knob which besides looking,1,1
sJ5vhShdVjo,1898080,2008960,which in most cases should be 18mm this potentiometer by the way is what actually adjusts the volume,1,1
sJ5vhShdVjo,4089920,4185920,audio both to and from the volume knob so after trimming the wires we need to group,1,1
sJ5vhShdVjo,10034720,10114384,speakers or headphones into its audio socket the volume on the source can then be set to,1,1
sJ5vhShdVjo,10114384,10198880,maximum which gives us the most volume range to work with and its then ready to use,1,1
sJ5vhShdVjo,10198880,10285760,it really does work a treat and evenly controls the volume from minimum to maximum when used,1,1

AQHcZklcltI,35184,66464,on triple integrals and volume,1,1
AQHcZklcltI,66464,108336,we can determine the volume of a solid region v,1,1
AQHcZklcltI,491568,528016,this will give us the volume of the solid,1,1
AQHcZklcltI,585584,630272,we can now use a triple integral to determine volume,1,1
AQHcZklcltI,804480,854400,were going to use this same principle to determine volume,1,1
AQHcZklcltI,913392,952816,here were going to determine the volume of the solid,1,1
AQHcZklcltI,3433232,3482048,and therefore will give us the volume of the solid,1,1
AQHcZklcltI,3521280,3548560,the volume that were determining,1,1
AQHcZklcltI,3548560,3613888,will be the volume of this triangular prism here,1,1
AQHcZklcltI,3636064,3678192,so lets go ahead and determine this volume,1,1
AQHcZklcltI,4862720,4909104,and we can see geometrically that the volume that we wanted,1,1
AQHcZklcltI,5188976,5211904,weve already determined the volume,1,1
AQHcZklcltI,6689584,6736176,so our volume would be equal to the triple integral,1,1
AQHcZklcltI,7580672,7612016,and this triple integral will give us the volume,1,1
AQHcZklcltI,7684736,7730624,so the volume that were determining is this region in here,1,1
AQHcZklcltI,7874784,7912240,lets go ahead and find that volume,1,1
AQHcZklcltI,9870288,9932960,and again this gives us the volume of region v,1,1
AQHcZklcltI,9947040,10000480,so 815 is the volume of this solid region here,1,1
